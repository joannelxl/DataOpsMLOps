Legendary infinity pool and great service,Well-located iconic hotel with an outstanding view from the rooftop. We stayed 2 nights in October.  The Check-in procedure was smooth. And our room was just amazing. We were upgraded to the family suite with a garden view.,October 2021,5,5.0
Great Pool Service!,It is understood that the views from the infinity pool are awesome. Unsurpassed. What made our visit extra special was the kind attention that Lifeguard Kelvin paid to ensuring that my friends and I captured those special moments. He voluntarily offered to take our pictures and ensured that he took his time to capture the moments with the highest quality. All the pictures were captured beautifully and made our visit all the more memorable. Thanks Kelvin!,February 2022,17,5.0
Best hotel service I have ever had,"Checked in here mid February and very much enjoyed the hotel. First the check in process was quick and professional. I even got a complimentary upgrade by signing up as a rewards member which was a nice surprise. The room was extremely clean and contained complimentary drinks and snacks in the mini bar and fridge which gets stocked daily. The staff here were phenomenal! From housekeeping staff to lifeguards at the pool I was greeted at every entrance, making conversation and genuinely happy to see me. The staff member Ryan (pool lifeguard) did a fantastic effort in making sure my experience at the pool was the best it could be. He offered me a towel as a headrest, took a few photos of me and made sure i my experience at the pool was constantly met. He and other staff members made my experience at MBS that much better. The highlight of the stay here was the infinity pool, you do need to book, however it means that the pool area is really quiet to the point where I have the entire pool to myself at particular moments of the day. Overall, this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. Customer service was phenomenal, overall service was great and had an amazing experience that I will never forget. Thank you MBS.",February 2022,1,5.0
Awesome Stay-cation,"It was an awesome experience to stay at this hotel. We were greeted by Joanne from Premium Services upon our arrival and was very informative and very helpful with our needs during our stay. From pool  to dining reservations, she handled it like a pro!We stayed at Orchid Suite City View and we were amazed by the view and the space of the room. We have an unobstructed view of the city skyline.We also had a great time at Club 55 from afternoon tea to Evening Drinks until next day‚Äôs breakfast!It was a very memorable stay and thank you for the staff who made this stay awesome.Special mention to Miss Joanne Gonzaga of Premium Services, and Miss Vella and Miss Kate from Club 55 for taking care of us all throughout our stay! You guys did a great job!",February 2022,189,5.0
An (Almost) Great MBS Experience,"Due to the pandemic and the fluid nature of border restrictions, we opted to spend our anniversary this year in Singapore again.  We opted for 3 separate staycations and, in order to compare the hotels we‚Äôve chosen, the duration for each of our staycations was the same duration and over the same days of different weeks.Marina Bay Sands was our second staycation.We had stayed once before but that memory was become fuzzy.  All I could remember was that the restroom was huge.Actually we didn‚Äôt plan to stay at the MBS.  However, due to the availability of a promotion, we decided to have our second staycation there ‚Äì and boy were we glad we did.We always opt for rooms with club benefits.  However, during the period of our staycation, all the rooms with club access were under renovation and only suites were available.  I decided against going for a suite since we would probably just stay on bed the whole time and would not be able to justify the hefty costs for the extra space in the suite.Hence, it was with trepidation that we booked for our stay from December 14 to 16 2021.  My wife was so apprehensive about the prospect of a staycation without club benefits that she wanted to cancel it. Pros:1.  MBS makes full use of technology.  Prior to our check-in, we received a link to select our preferred check-in time.  This totally removed the need to speak with the front desk at the start of our staycation.  We also got to book our slots for the use of the infinity pools and other hotel facilities. 2.  The hotel is really serious about its safe management measures.  This is the ONLY hotel that checks in every guest who uses the lifts to the room and checks out every guest who exits the lifts.  There is no way extra ‚Äòguests‚Äô can make their way into the guest rooms.3.  The air-con in the room works fantastically well.  The room was chilled to the level of our liking! 4. Although we stayed in an ordinary room, the mini bar was replenished daily and it was free!What a treat! 5.  I have always thought that having a TV in the room was a silly idea.  However, MBS managed to change that opinion of mine because its smart TV was easy to connect to my phone and we could watch Netflix on TV.  I have stayed in hotels that have smart TVs that are impossible to connect.   Staying at the MBS was like staying at home ‚Äì only better.6.  My initial thought that the check-in process was one that was going to spoil my staycation due to the sheer number of people at the lobby.  However my personal experience was a super pleasant one.  I was ushered into a room with a seat and was attended to by a very thorough and professional Ms Adilah.  Ms Adilah did not ask questions as a filler or just to make small talk.  She asked questions so that she could provide solutions.  For example, she asked if I have booked for my pool sessions.  When I told her I could not get a timing for the first day, she took the trouble to secure a slot after making a few checks.  To me, the checking in process sets the tone for my stay.  Thank you, Ms Adilah!    7.  There are a lot to do at the Marina Shoppes.  Because my membership was upgraded to the next tier, it made shopping and dinning at the restaurants linked via the escalators an even better experience.8.  Checking out was equally efficient.  No forms.  No queues.  Just drop your room card and its done.Cons:Normally I would have a long list of cons.  For MBS, the ONLY negative point I would give was for our unfortunate dinner experience at the Rise Restaurant located in the lobby.  Not only was the waiting time for our food unduly long, the taste way of the fried rice and satay were below mediocre.I really don‚Äôt think the restaurant can justify the 40-minute waiting time for a plate of fried rice and a few sticks of satay. Moreover, our order of satay came undercooked!  The mutton was impossible to chew and the meat was red and bloody.  I had to spit it out. When I informed the wait staff, the remaining 2 sticks of satay were sent back to the kitchen and returned  - charred and inedible.On hindsight, I thought even a regular restaurant would have prepared another 2-3 sticks of satay and served them to us instead of taking the undercooked ones back into the kitchen to char them.Given the current pandemic situation, I thought the restaurant should have known better.Moreover,   I would say that the satay served at Rise was of the worst I‚Äôve tasted offered by any restaurants in any hotel.  This is definitely does not live up to an MBS standard and reputation.  The dinner at Rise was the only bad experience we had during our short staycation.  It kinds of spoilt our dinner on the second night of our stay.Would we stay again?  We would love to experience the club lounge at the Marina Bay Sands Singapore.   I want to believe it is going to be of a standard above the rest. But we‚Äôll probably never going to step into Rise again.",December 2021,563,5.0
Fantastic stay and Superb Service,"My husband and I checked in last weekend and we really had a great stay with this hotel. We booked a club room with club access. Our room is really big, clean and nice. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Vincent and Aries for taking care of us while we were having afternoon tea and cocktails. We really appreciate their efforts in making sure we were okey while we were at Club55. Sometimes the service is reason why the guest comes back and I can say that those people convinced us to come back through the BEST service that they provided to us. Kudos to MBS and all the staff. We will definitely come back.",February 2022,20,5.0
Marina Bay Sands,"Given that MBS is an excellent hotel to stay and relax, I want to give my appreciation to Mr. MOE (Ministry of Entertainment) üòÇ for taking our photos it‚Äôs really great for our social media feeds.

Birthday treat,When we checked in I told them it was my birthday. Daniel then told me he had upgraded us to a suite. It was unbelievable! Huge with floor to ceiling windows on both sides and phenomenal views! I will never forget this experience. Dinner at C‚Äôest La Vie and a swim in the rooftop pool in the morning topped it all off. I would highly recommend this hotel for a special occasion.,February 2022,50,5.0

Great stay with the family,"The stay was a birthday gift from the missus. It went smoothly from checkin to checkout. All the staff were great but a special mention to Moe at the pool.

Horrible hospitality and customer service,"I tried to book a hotel reservation with the company and they refuse to send me a confirmation. I need this reservation for my travel visa to Singapore with friends and family, but I've been waiting DAYS for their confirmation and because of it, missed my chance to apply for VISA.For the families that did go, they canceled their booking with marina Bay sands after their horrendous customer service. The front desk was incredibly rude when we needed help with check in.Priort to arrival, when we asked for a manager, he promptly ignored our inquiries about whether or not we need to:1. quarantine in the hotel until a negative test2. would send us a confirmation email for room reservationWhen my family went to the actual hotel to speak to a supervisor about this, they said it was out of their hands that they can't control their managers response times. What? What kind of customer service is this? Additionally, it took a long time for them to check us in. The situation was so horrible and I heavily don't recommend this place for future travellers.We promptly cancelled our reservation, without caring for a refund, and departed to another hotel that appreciated our service. Super disappointed and will be warning all of my peers from this place.",January 2022,1,1.0
Best hotel in Singapore and worth every penny!!,"Awesome hotel with the best views, location and service. It was amazing to watch the spectra light and water show from our room. We were on the 45th floor and the room was large with comfortable beds. The pool which is exclusive to hotel guests only is spectacular! Shopping galore and worth every penny. Definitely the best hotel in Singapore!",May 2022,4,5.0
Room Service,"This is purely about their room service. It took 5 mins for them to respond and they informed us that they had wait times of over an hour. This is ridiculous for a 5 star hotel that I am paying nearly SGD2000. Unheard of anywhere else in the world, but in Singapore, all they say is suck it. I am still here.",May 2022,16,1.0
Perfect destination for luxurious holidays,"We had stayed there specifically for the reason to access their trademark Infinity pool with a view of singapore skyline. And we were not disappointed. We were able to access the pool as many times as we want. The pool is opened from 6 Am to 11 Pm. The water is good, the service is perfect, they have people serving refreshments along the pool sides at no extra cost.The rooms are luxurious with perfect services for in room dining as well. Particularly Mr. Sean had taken care that my 3 year old baby is also served well. Brought some in house chocolates for her along with my beer tasting bucket. They extended our check out till 2 PM. Which was very convenient with 2 babies. Overall it was a perfect experience with quality service and with proper amenities and a pleasant experience for my family of 4.",April 2022,11,5.0
Great service by the room attendant,"The stay at MBS is wonderful as per usual. We managed to get the room immediately upon check in at 1pm, which was great.

Luxurious property,"We booked a Deluxe King Sky View Room on the 44th floor. It was a very spacious room with an amazing view. The team was nice enough to provide us with an early check-in. The service was pretty quick as our luggage had reached the room before us and the extra bed was placed within 5 minutes of that. The pool is obviously amazing at any point of time and they have amazing hot tubs as well. The drinks in the pool are not that costly. Sling or pina colada costs SGD 25-26 (inclusive of taxes). I would suggest anyone who is visiting Singapore to stay on this hotel for at least one night and enjoy the property, be it the room, pool, casino or mall.",May 2022,10,5.0
Living in Opulence!,"Stay: 4th May to 5th May 2022Booking: SelfReview:Value for Money: Booked the Deluxe Room (Garden View) directly through mail interaction with their reservation desk @ Sing Dollar (SGD) 1,046.35/- per night which is a luxury but totally worth it. We got bumped up the Deluxe Room King size (Garden view) Tower 2 which sweetened the deal. The room is on the 47th floor and had the Gardens viewService Quality: Awesome. Hotel staff is accommodating in every sense of the word. Smooth check-in and very comfortableFood & Drink: The hotel has lots of choices to choose from and the same can be browsed from the in-room TV menu.

Marquee hotel in SingaporeAmenities: Two words - INFINITY POOL!!! There is free WI-Fi.  There is the casino, Sands Expo and convention halls. The AC chills you quite comfortably.

Staycation at MBS,"There‚Äôs nothing bad to say anything about this hotel! Our experience there was awesome. Room was big n clean, comfy pillow. Service from the hotel staffs was awesome especially from Infinity Pool Mr Moe & team. Location is perfect too! The staff, Moe is very thoughtful and observant. He shared pics on his mobile on which best time and location to take on sunrise, sunset & A Light & Water show at night. He has helped us to take on our family photo. We felt so touched by his warm gesture. The staff give us complimentary beverages during swimming session in the evening on last Friday, May 6 with this pleasant thought. We will come back again.",May 2022,1,5.0
Infinity Pool is Amazing,"My wife and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for three nights in May of 2022. Would I recommend this resort to a friend? Yes. Would I stay their again knowing what I know now about the resort? Yes.We had a Deluxe King Sky View. It had great views of the city and skyline. The only reason we stayed at the hot was for access to the roof top infinity pool. It it wasn‚Äôt for the pool I would not stay at the hotel. It doesn‚Äôt feel like you are staying in a hotel. It feels like you are staying in a mall. The hotel is big and impersonal. The pool is great. Amazing views of the city. However, my wife and I were wanting to have a drink in the pool and watch the sun set. Sounds great doesn‚Äôt it. But the pool area does not have an adult only section or pool. This means that there are always screaming splashing kids around you. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I raised two screaming splashing kids. However when you‚Äôre paying $1000/night for a room, an adult only section in the pool isn‚Äôt too much to ask for. Additionally, my wife loves to have a bath before bed and the deluxe rooms only have showers. WI-FI in the rooms was strong. Free waters and sodas in the room were a nice touch. Also the free ice cream at the pool. We signed up for the Sands reward club and got free breakfast at Spagos and a free happy hour one night. If you found my review helpful please let me know by giving me a Thumbs Up.",May 2022,"2,775",4.0
"Once in a lifetime of experience to be in the infinity pool, great service with personal note by Moe Lamit - thank you!","We stayed there 5 days and it is a great Hotel with excellent service. Room service took too long but can understand the lack of staff after Covid hit this sector so hard. The view is of course outstanding but we also got in touch with Mr Moe Lamit working at the infinity pool. He was so friendly, offered to make pictures of us and shared insider ideas abt Singapore. We even stayed in contact after our visit and this made the stay at MBS even more special. Thanks for the unforgettable stay",July 2022,1,5.0
Best pool in the world!,"We stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon. The view from the room was amazing - and even more breathtaking from the infinity pool! I recommend that you book your restaurants well in advance of your vacation. Sadly most of the restaurants at the hotel were fully booked for the duration of our stay, which didn‚Äôt leave many options for us. Room service took a very long time, which is understandable given the size of the hotel.  We appreciated the chocolates offered to us by the hotel, as a gift for our honeymoon. We were very impressed with the housekeeping staff who did an amazing job. The hotel is in walking distance of the Gardens on the Bay, which is a great activity for tourists. Definitely the place to stay in Singapore!",July 2022,25,4.0

Good,"The infinity pool on the roof of Marina Bay Sands makes it worth staying at this hotel with family. Icon of singaporean and must to coma here if come to singapore. Room is good, food is tasty, staff is friendly.",July 2022,13,5.0
A Singapore Classic,"The Marina Bay Sands is a great hotel but its beigeness is starting to look a little dated.  The views are outstanding and the location is very impressive.  Tonnes of overpriced designer stores, and a relatively close food court and other good eating options nearby, seemingly for the Mainland Chinese visitors, good access for MRT and Taxis are almost non stop. The rooms were large and very comfortable, we all loved the automatic curtains and the large bathrooms.The Gardens by the bay are a great experience with the shuttle if the idea of a walk in 28c doesn't appeal to you.  The nearby Art and Science museum was an unexpectedly fun trip and worth the visit if you have kids or a curious nature.Its so large its almost tiring to walk around and the lifts make it a bit complex to reach the pool, but its well worth it for the experience and the occasional free ice creams and drinks.  The gym needs a bit of updating, some of the equipment is getting a tiny bit tired.Its a fabulous structure in a fabulous location.  Everything works, albeit things like room service were unforgivably slow, $17 for a couple of slices of toast which takes 50 minutes to arrive is really not good enough.  The room service food selection overall is large but a bit basic, and could do with an overhaul.The Check-in process needs much less process.  They are far too keen to get you in a queue and it would be much faster to just provide faster simpler service.  An awful lot of looking and typing and looking and typing and confirming things in frankly pretty bad English is what I would expect from a regular 4 star.  Even check out was a long and unnecessarily drawn out affair compared to other Singapore hotels.  I think a robot check-in and out would be an attractive alternative option.All in all its a fabulous hotel that has a good 12 years of service and is undergoing a refurb at the moment and if they get it right it will be a great hotel for the next decade too.",July 2022,199,4.0
Great but‚Ä¶.,"I‚Äôm staying at the hotel at the moment and I wanted to give my initial impressions.  The check-in process as well as booking to use the infinity pool are a bit quirky. Both require registration within 24 hours of arrival but the system was down when I tried and the backup mobile number also did not work. Slightly unusually, the reservations team does not seem to be as accessible as in other hotels (a bit slow). Prior to arrival, you are certainly left feeling that you have booked at a five-star hotel, but you are not being treated as an essential customer.Upon arrival, we had a short wait during our registered check-in period but once all the paperwork had been completed (took longer than checking in at other hotels) we were left to our room and started enjoying the premises.Wow. This is a one-of-a-kind property and the views from the room (we booked two deluxe sky view rooms) are amazing. This is definitely a hotel that you want to stay in at least once if you are visiting Singapore.  The children have really enjoyed the experience so far and we can see that the hotel is going to be an excellent base for exploring the various attractions.  We feel very safe (coming from Dubai) with the hygiene and Covid protocols here.  There is still a requirement to wear masks (like Dubai) indoors and it feels safe to us having that although I appreciate that it‚Äôs relaxed more in other parts of the world. We had our first breakfast at RISE this morning. The buffet was pretty good. However, as guests from the Middle East we did observe that there is a lack of understanding on our questions around halal food. Most five star restaurants at least understand the question and are able to reply with a yes or no. We have a booking today at the infinity pool so we are excited to check that out. Look out for my next post as we work through our stay here!",August 2022,9,3.0
Infinity Pool,"The infinity pool on the roof of Marina Bay Sands makes it worth staying at this hotel alone. Despite the jaw dropping skyline views and the delicious food an drink options, one thing that made this trip memorable was a life guard named Moe. Upon attempting to take poor angled selfies with the gorgeous views, Moe charismatically offered his services to snap some photos of my girlfriend and I while catching all the perfect angles. I highly recommend this hotel, pool, and saying hello to my good friend Moe.",August 2022,5,5.0
Faultless!,I felt really special the second I arrived. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and I felt really welcomed. I was lucky enough to get my room upgraded and the view blew me away! The infinity pool is absolutely beautiful and the perfect place to unwind. Special mention to Fir who was one of the pool staff - I was travelling solo and he helped me out getting some amazing photos in the pool with that incredible view. Would stay again in a heartbeat.,July 2022,18,5.0
Moe is the best,"It‚Äôs our first visit to Singapore. Did a fine choice of choosing MBS for our vacation. All was good from checking-in, room service & all service staff. But Moe from Infinity Pool has set a very high standard of an Exclusive Service which make MBS stand out. His goal of having in mind ‚Äòmaking us a RETURN GUESTS‚Äô is an asset to MBS. His recommendation of the facilities the hotel got to offer, the In-house celebrity restaurant help us a lot of make to do during our stay and where to dine. Moe‚Ä¶ you are the BEST!",July 2022,1,5.0

Overpriced View,"I am basing my review on equivalent hotels worldwide at the price of over $600 a night which what I paid per night.  Firstly I booked a City View and the room has an incredible view, we slept with the blinds open as it was so amazing.  We were on level 35.  The room is good, but not amazing for this price.  The room we had at the Hyatt was double the size for less money and the service was equally as good.You could only book the famous infinity pool for 1 hour a day that is it and the spaces are limited, so you may end up like many people with a timeslot that is not great.  The gym was the same, you have to book which was relatively simple, but we arrived after the Singapore NY festivities, so it was alot quieter.  For this price, I would expect a little more customer service like using the pool and gym a little more than once a day.  I couldn't even get a drink or a coffee at the pool and the pool water was freezing.  Even the staff agreed that the water is freezing.The check in process was long.  There were no queues, but it feels like they are doing background checks etc as it takes a long time to get a room key.  For example to get in and out of room at the elevator lobby, there is a guard that records your room number.  I even received a call while at dinner from the hotel asking me to approve another credit card deposit as they only took out $400 when I checked in.  I wasn't really sure why the man was calling me and interrupting my dinner when they had my credit card and I was going to pay.  So we checked into Tower 3, but when we were waiting in Tower 1 to go to dinner, there are these people dressed in red tops.  They are the hotel police that literally are looking for any excuse to call you out for sitting in the wrong place.  My mask slipped to the tip of my nose, not below my nose and I was told off.  Again for this price, I wouldn't stay here again as I had way better experiences at the other hotels that treat you like a VIP guest.We ended up going back to Orchard everyday anyway as it so much better than Marina Bay.  This is my second stay.  now I have experienced both sides of the hotel, I definitely won't stay again at these prices.  I only booked it to impress my girlfriend.",January 2022,319,3.0
Very Pathetic Customer Service,"I booked two rooms for 2 days for my family of 6 under the Sandsational Staycation package over the Christmas holidays. On the MBS website, it says that complimentary breakfast would be provided if you sign up as a Sands Reward Member. What I experienced was having to jump through multiple hoops and walking back and forth between Tower 1 and Tower 3 on multiple occasions to get the breakfast voucher.To the hotel's credit and our pleasant surprise, they allowed us to check in early at 9 a.m. and the process at Tower 3 reception was smooth. However, we were told to go to Tower 1 Sands Rewards counter to get our physical membership card. When I went there in the afternoon, there was a long queue at the counter. I was told that after getting the card, I needed to go to the machine to collect our breakfast vouchers. There was another queue for the single machine, but Mr Zack Chang told me I could go to the other machine at Tower 1. So I walked back but found the queue no better. I then returned to Tower 3 and queued again. However, after going through all the options in the machine, I could not see any vouchers. I then asked Mr Chang for help. He said it was not yet in the system and asked me to come back half an hour later. Long walk back to my room in Tower 3 and back to Tower 1 half an hour later. Still nothing in the machine. Mr Chang then offered to write out the vouchers for me manually, but only for 4 persons. I told him that we had an email from MBS that confirmed breakfast for 6. He said the rewards system is separate from the hotel system, so I would have to check with the restaurant. After some argument with him, he finally agreed to issue vouchers for 6.I also asked about breakfast for the following day and he said it would be in the machine by the next day. Guess what? The next day, the machine only had breakfast vouchers for 3 persons! Long walk again to Tower 1, queue again and this time it was Mr Wong Wei Siang. It was like a re-enactment of the movie Edge of Tomorrow starring Tom Cruise. He had no idea what happened the day before. I had to explain the whole story again. He scrolled through his computer for 20 minutes and still could not understand the problem. I then request that he wrote out the vouchers for me manually. By now, I was not surprised when he said the same thing: We were entitled to only 4 vouchers; the remaining 2 had to pay! If I had a problem I needed to take this up with the hotel and restaurant separately! I explained that 6 of us had eaten breakfast that morning and he could verify with the RISE restaurant After a heated discussion, he finally agreed to issue vouchers for 6. I had to go off by then for another event. So long walk back to Tower 3 and later in the day return to Tower 1 again to collect the vouchers. If the hotel had any sense of service, they would have offered to leave them in our room after putting us through all that hassle. It's obvious that there is little coordination between the Sands Reward team and the hotel side. The Reward team is there basically to support the casino and clearly sees serving the hotel customers as a burdensome chore, unless they are high-rollers. Even though we don't gamble, we had paid over $800 per room per night, and the level of service was truly appalling.I ran into another problem when I was checking out. I asked for two separate bills for the two rooms. I was told by the lady at the counter that it could not be done. Why not? The incredible answer was that at check-in they had taken one single deposit for both rooms using the one credit card! I patiently pointed out that I had intentionally made two separate bookings, because I wanted two bills. After I insisted, the lady made some phone calls, and then tried to dissuade me again. I stood my ground, and she finally cancelled the deposit and billed me separately for the two rooms. The good thing was I got lots of exercise from staying there but I doubt I will come back.",December 2021,24,2.0
First and last time here,So much for safe distancing when there is no proper waiting area and massive crowd waiting to checkin. Everyone just standing in crowds outside the shops. Massive waiting times to check in. We understand COVID-19 is leading to more checks and measures but to wait 1-2 hours for checkin is really unacceptable. Service level below average for the supposed top tier hotel. And more long queues for breakfast at the hotel. Management needs to look at themselves as to why there are long queues everywhere. Poor staffing planning. The poor staff are overworked and overwhelmed due to shortage of staff. Looks like the existing staff need to cover 3 persons work at the expense of 1. Social distancing measures are a joke. Having stayed at other hotels the intrusion of privacy and constant surveillance every time you go in and out of the room is ridiculous. Take a long hard look at yourself sands management cos no other hotels are doing what you‚Äôre doing and how disorganised everything is. Safe ambassadors are a joke and on a power trip with lack of basic courtesy,December 2021,17,2.0
"Not first time MBS hotel staycation but probably my last, at least for awhile.","I remembered the first time I stayed at MBS hotel. It was my birthday and my husband(then bf) arranged a surprise staycation for me at MBS. Everything was perfect. Then we have this thought to have staycation at MBS for at least once a year. Last year, we have our ROM and Honeymoon staycation at MBS in Aug 2020 and Oct 2020. I can say that was the most memorable stay at MBS. The staff that attended to us auto-upgraded our room to club room for FOC and give us a late check-out. All the staff we met was friendly greeting us(except for the staff at club 55 that served those guest that booked the club room as we are not aware only those guest that ""booked"" the club room is allow to enter the facility and we are given ""FOC"" for the club room so we are not allow to enter, the staff explain that to us with a ""look down on people"" face and tone). But we still enjoyed the staycation as we met many more other friendly staff. In Dec 2020, I arranged a staycation at MBS again to celebrate my husband birthday. During then, the staff attended to us was ok too and try to fulfil on our request. Though we met some unhappiness back then, but the staff tried to rectify the issue quickly for us. But this year, Dec 2021, when I arranged staycation at MBS for my husband birthday, I was very very surprise with all the ""new"" stuff that I am not aware of during my past stay in MBS. Firstly,  the check-out time is 11am(which I am really surprised, as during my past stay, the earliest checkout was 12PM, latest was 1PM).Secondly, the parking is not FOC for guest. For this I swear I really had no idea during my past stay. If not my husband want to confirm and asked me to check with the staff, we could have pay for the parking for this staycation and I am sure the amount is not a small sum. But for this, at least the staff attended to us say she will give us a complimentary parking at last.Thirdly, I indicated that it is a birthday surprise for my husband. I am glad the staff wished my husband ""Happy birthday"" during check-in. But she actually told my husband that they will send a cake to us from 3pm. Which it become not a surprise. Other 4 or 5 stars hotel I stayed before will make this arrangement as a ""surprise"" without informing you in advance. That is the reason why we put it as ""special request"" isn't it?Fourth, the room that was upgraded for us is nothing compared to the one we stayed during our ROM and Honeymoon staycation. But for this, probably we are putting too high expectation from MBS based on our past experienced, hence, was rather disappointed.Fifth, the Covid-19 virus still exist, during last year stay there is plastic vacuum for the cup, towel, amenity to assure the guest for the cleanliness. But I am not sure why this time round there is no such ""safety"" effort.Sixth, the cake that was told will be send to our room was late. I even called the service to check and then they managed to deliver it to us at last close to 10pm. I was really worry it might past my husband birthday by the time they send the cake to our room.I would say the whole experience for the staycation this time make me and my husband felt that what we paid is not worth what we received. There is really nothing special about MBS if I were to compare it with other 5 stars hotel. With this price, probably I can receive a better treatment from other hotel. My husband is even the member of MBS but I would say there is nothing you can expect from MBS even if you are the member of MBS.",December 2021,1,2.0
"Comfortable, Decadent couple stay during Covid","We had a complimentary upgrade and my request for a quiet room was met as it was away from the elevator. The wait till check in was heavily regulated due to Covid but the service was fantastic. I signed up for an MBS membership that same day too. The room was very classy, clean and had a great view of the Gardens by the bay. We booked our pool slot in advance and loved the view from the top too. Despite the ever-changing measures for Covid (we could not dine in at that time), I had to order food as takeaway from restaurants. The food was packed well and I made sure to order it before the dinner crowd arrived. Some of the entrances and exits were a bit confusing though. Having the MBS membership is a plus because it applies to all shops and restaurants in the shoppes and hotel. Would definitely stay again for the air-conditioned  atmosphere (everything is interconnected apart from the gardens) and privacy.",June 2021,30,5.0
Staycation - 2 nights with breakfast and $100 dining credits,"I stayed at marina bay sands for 2 nights. This is a large hotel and there are things to take note of. 1. Booking or pool You can book for a slot at the infinity pool 1 day prior to check in. For our stay. We have 3  slots. 1 slot per day. Each 1 hour 15 mins. You can book all slots at the same time. I would advise you to book earlier as many slots are not available when I tried to book. 2. Check in The check in time is at 3pm. I reached the hotel at 2:45 and have a hard time self parking. In the end I valet park instead. The hotel car parking is surprisingly full with many cars waiting for an empty lot. In the end I was at the check in counter at 3:10. I have to wait for about 15 mins before I check in.  A bit of waiting. 3. RoomThe room is decent. The tv is large but the movie Channels is very poor. Most movies are very old. I have a room on 36th floor at the Tower 3. The view from the room marvelous. 4. PoolMake sure you have slots in the day time and night time. The night view from the pool is very beautiful. with capacity limit the pool is not crowded at all. The entry of the slots is enforced very strictly. 5. BreakfastI have a choice of breakfast in the room, at spago on the 57th floor or ar Rise on the ground floor. I tried spago first. The food is ok and not as good as what they served in Rise. Also the morning sun is very glaring and the table is very low. Not a relaxing breakfast experience. I went very early and do not have to wait to eat or be served. The second breakfast at rise is nicer. But I was there later and have to wait. They are very short staffed and the wait is very very long. Something to bear in mind if you have plans in the mornings after breakfast.",December 2021,127,4.0

Couldn‚Äôt wait to stay but was RESTRICTED AF,"Pool rules of 1hr per person per day had just gone. Yet we still had to check in. It was a bit of a mess. We would all line up in the heat and some people couldn‚Äôt get the thing to work. Not the best when youve been dying to visit the most iconic pool in the world. We couldn‚Äôt get a drink and swim because there are only certain times for that. So had to plan accordingly. Whatever happened to pool side service? I literally only stayed for the pool. The casino was a nightmare. No drinks in sight. That‚Äôs changed. You can‚Äôt even get a water. One night I went downstairs at 10pm to visit 7/11 and was stopped by security. ‚ÄúCLOSED‚Äù but was told by staff it‚Äôs open. Hotel check in took forever be aware of this as it eats into pool and dinner time. Checkout is a breeze with the card drop. Room service took 50-80 mins. Spagos service was lovely.

She took care of everything, she even upgraded my room as i mentioned that it was my first time to stay in that hotel. Everything was perfect and seamless. RJ helped me booked for the swimming pool when she asked if I made a booking already, but i did not. She explained everything that I need even for the pre departure pcr test that we need for my flight. She was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The restaurants are awesome, and the hotel is very convenient to go for shopping since everything is just a few minutes walk away from the hotel.

Massive and iconic,"We stayed a night in a garden view deluxe room and found it amazing. This is not a hotel, it is a resort with more than 2500 rooms.Still, check in was rather effektive.

Rooms were great with good amenties and great views of the gardens and the supertree grove.We spent an intire day first row in the world renowned infinity pool. To be honest - this is why we booked a room here. One thing we did not understand is why the signage told that children had to be above 13 yrs to enter, but a lot of 7-8-9 yr old still splashed around, ruining the experience for other guests.

A great getaway for a special occasion with the family,"Perfect (& costly) getaway for the Family. Customer service is excellent given the many service staff everywhere. We are assigned a unit in Tower 1 for our 3 nights stay on the 46th level facing the sea. The view is simply spectacular. Checking in took about 30 minutes on a Sun afternoon but checking out is a breeze. One just need to drop your card keys into the quick checkout stand located outside the lift lobby. Booking for the infinity pool located on level 57 is simple, either via SMS or by scanning the QR code on the check in brochure.  Same goes for the Banyan GYM on level 55 in Tower 2.  Dining in the hotel will set you back by about S$80 to $100 per pax. Comparatively, the food court in basement 2 of the convention centre just opposite the hotel accessible via the underground passage is cheaper.  Bathroom is huge with a standalone bathtub and toothbrushes are replaced everyday.  There are lots of complimentary bottled water, coke, sprite, apple and orange juice that are replenished everyday with the snacks and tea. The coffee maker brewed fresh coffee. Room is huge with lots of mirrors and the sleep quality is good. Bathrobes and house slippers are changed daily too. Last but not least, the hotel surprised us with a slice of complimentary birthday  cake left in the room while we were out celebrating. Kudos for the excellent customer service!!",March 2022,928,5.0

Fabulous hotel ... but don't expect to seep on Saturday night!,"The hotel is lovely - we've had fantastic meals in a couple of the restaurants (Spago, Lavo), have been to the infinity pool and had breakfast at Rise. The staff overall have been lovely and super helpful.As with anything, you need to pick your time well if you want to avoid the queues. Just in from Australia, we were in Rise for breakfast at 7am - no queues. We also visited the infinity pool at 9am rather than one of the busier parts of the day. Yes it can be busy but you can plan around it.The downside that you can't plan around, is the behaviour of other guests. On a Saturday night, the hotel is 'party central' with people coming back from other venues and 'kicking on' in their rooms. The music has thumped incessantly from about 3am to 6.15 so far and no signs of it slowing down yet. We'll be back for sure, but probably not to stay the night and definitely not on a Saturday night.

Amazing location & facility. That‚Äôs it though.,"This is an amazing place, the location is incredible and the facility has great amenities. However this is where it begins and ends.Breakfast- wait in a line for up to 10 mins to be seated each morning. Wait in another line for up to 10 mins at most food station. A very uneasy and stressful way to begin your day on a vacation. Staff- perhaps due to covid, bad management or lack of care the staff are generally quite rude. Particularly the staff at the pool area. It‚Äôs closer to an asylum rather than a pool. From being greeted with ‚Äúare you going to your room‚Äô rather than a hello or good morning. Good luck using your own infinity pool also, you‚Äôll need to book each day of your generous 45 mins of pool time at least 1 week In advance. I will say this is not to the valet staff, they were all very friendly and helpful. In room dining- we ordered numerous times and had phone them back again to ask for our change as the staff thought they could take $20 tips for $30 meals. Would never come back here nor recommend this hotel to anybody.",March 2022,6,2.0

Fabulous Experience,"We booked a Grand Club garden view room overlooking Gardens by the Bay on one side and overlooking the city from the bathroom. We also had access to Club55 with our room which gave us breakfast here, in Spago or in the regular breakfast area. We also enjoyed an afternoon tea which was included. The suite was truly incredible and the service we received was very professional. We didn‚Äôt have to queue for the lifts as others have mentioned. We managed to book 1hr 15 minutes each day of our stay at the pool. There was plenty of slots available which meant we could go in the morning and the evening for photos. The breakfast at Spago was brilliant, the portion sizes are huge and it‚Äôs very tasty. The room service options are vast, plenty of options to choose from either Asian influenced dishes, Western dishes or authentic Singaporean dishes. We wanted to stay for the swimming pool and the incredible views, but wasn‚Äôt expecting the service to be as good due to the vast size of the hotel but it was honestly faultless. Truly one of the best hotels we‚Äôve visited.",February 2022,28,5.0
Personalised service and exceptional amenities and food,"We were concerned about the scale of the hotel and the number of guests and how that might impact our stay, but from even before reaching the hotel, we were so wonderfully assisted by a personalized check in staff as part of premier check-in services that we didn't need to worry about a thing. The luggage magically came to the room and left the room without us needing to supervise, thanks to the very able luggage staff and the exceptional operational management. It is worth staying in the suites for this premiere experience. Each dining option offered by the hotel is just fabulous, with the stunning views from Club 55, the beautifully crafted cakes and savouries at Renku, and especially the widespread and delicious breakfast selections at Rise. The ease with which the scale of operation at breakfast at Rise is managed is just remarkable. The swimming pool experience was also memorable, and we managed to go at times when the crowds were a little less. The suite itself was beautifully appointed, with all necessities placed in the correct position. The views were stunning..we were lucky to get a corner room for an Orchid suite, which offered both city and garden views with sunset and sunrise views. The large windows with mechanised curtains truly elevate the experience. The bathroom and all its amenities, including the selection of toiletries, was extremely premiere. And it is extremely easy to access the towers, the mall, and the various dining places due to the logical layout of the whole complex. The only thing thing that needs a bit of improvement is the elevator waiting time when exiting the sky deck. Overall, amazing stay and we will come back.",August 2022,52,5.0
Last night in Singapore,I have stayed here 3 times now loved the first 2 visits not so good this time. The hotel is great lovely room and the pool is wonderful unfortunately you now have to book the pool our morning booking didn‚Äôt get to poolside but the man on duty kindly let us in.Pool and sky bar are lovely but we were refused entry before leaving for the airport at 5pm were told all tables were booked in spite of it being empty. We were given a bar stool seat and the restaurant remained empty till we left.We had booked a twin room but were given a double/king bed told we had an upgrade with club facilities yet couldn‚Äôt use a conference type of room for my daughter to use for some work she had to do.Previously we had breakfast included the high tea and canap√©s from 5-7pm now this is only included with Suites.Singapore has many beautiful hotels and I would not spend so much money staying at the Sands again Disappointed. Not a very welcoming place anymore,August 2022,22,4.0
Must Stay!!,"Marina Bay Sands is a MUST STAY! Not only is the room cozy, the hotel is smack dab in the center of everything. Everything was in walking distance or a short uber ride. The light shows, the mall & the never ending choice of  foods is the reason we will definitely be back! Also thank you for our front desk check in person, Jia Qi, you were so helpful in setting us up for an incredible stay. We appreciate everything!",August 2022,12,5.0
Short stay,"This was our second visit and was really hoping for a better experience but it was soulless, cold natured, boring and absolutely no vibe. Everything we did as a family was hard, had to make reservations to empty restaurants, hours were bizarre and just seemed like a communist strict dull city. All the gear no idea.",August 2022,1,1.0
It‚Äôs a Disney world,It‚Äôs a Disney World. You have to wait for everything. You have to pre-register what time you want to check in. You get a ticket and wait for your number to be called just to check in.The pool is cool. But you get only 1.5h a day and you have to register what time you want to access 24h prior. And it‚Äôs nothing relaxing. Full of Instagrammers taking photos and the staffs are constantly asking your room numbers to ensure 1.5h limit. The rooms are okay. Service is okay but nothing personal. Never again.,August 2022,13,2.0
Great stop over,"On our way to Bali we stayed one night at the Marina Bay Sands.Everything from check inn to check out was very professional done.

Birthday Celebration,"Excellent 4 night stay at this massive 5 star hotel. The amazing roof top infinity swimming pool on 57th floor offers a panoramic view of the city. The observation deck also offers panoramic views of harbour and the city.The check in service was quick and all the staff were very friendly, polite and helpful. The room service was high class. The continental buffet breakfast offers a wide selection of different cuisines with local tropical fruits and juices.",August 2022,111,5.0
Worth it?  YES!!,"Great hotel and great experience.  The staff are very friendly, the hotel and rooms are extremely clean and the views are panoramic.  Overall, Marina Bay Sands is worth the price of staying there at least once.  The infinity pool is almost always open (6am-11pm) and was not crowded at all.  During our stay there, we went to the pool as many times as we could and easily found lounge chairs.  My only complaint is that the pool is not heated so it can get cold especially in the mornings.  The food at the restaurants and the food court was delicious.  The hotel is walking distance from one of the hawker centers (Lau Pa Sat) passing the marina into downtown.  The metro station and bus stops are right there so taking public transportation was not a problem.  We did our own city tour using the MRT with the help of the Concierge who told us where to go, what sites to see, and where to eat.  Overall, an excellent trip.  Will definitely go back!",August 2022,127,5.0
We choose Marina Bay for the swimming pool and for the fact that the place is notorious but we enjoy the time we spent,The staff is very friendly. The restaurants are great The view from 42nd floor is amazing. Many stores inside. It is like a small town. Go to Skypark Observation Deck to enjoy a panoramic vista of the island. The swimming pool is realy amazing.,August 2022,2,5.0
Awesome View,Service for check-in was quick. You will need to register before checking in so that you won't have to wait long. Sms will be sent informing you of your Queue number. We stayed at L51 at Tower 3 with City View. The room is huge with two big tv screens. The view is awesome. In the front is the city view that overlooks the water and on the left is the Garden by the bay view. The infinity pool has great views too. A little crowded but we managed to take some great photos. They were short staff but service is still top notch. The night view is best with lights up from Garden of the Bay as well as the city view. There is no time limit to using the pool.,August 2022,46,4.0
Great views but....,"It seems to be a must do while in the city.  Once you get to the top there are great views but like everything else in Singapore (apart from the trains) it is expensive to eat/drink there.As a visitor you need to pay to get to the top platform but are restricted in the areas you can go to unless you are a resident - as in you cannot go to the infinity pool.  Cost per person is $22SGD/¬£13/16USD as of February 2020.The views of the city and shoreline are great, it overlooks the F1 circuit and I would consider it a must do on a visit.  If you can afford to stay there you will get much more however as a tourist it should be on your Singapore bucket list.  It is also great to wander around the ground and mall on ground level.",September 2021,254,4.0

Great stay,"There was a system glitch at the time of check in and hotel staff was struggling to let guests check in on time at 3 pm. Most of the guests had to stay in the lobby lounge area even after 5 pm and it wasn‚Äôt the experience expected after paying $800++ per room per night.However, the reception staff Alice was genuinely concerned about us as we just arrived following a long flight and she noted it was my birthday, she ensured escalating the matter to her manager Lydia who took care of us very well. Both of them ensured that we were taken care of as best as possible while trying to resolve the check in issue beyond their control. Thanks to both of them they turned a very stressful check in to a win by their service and ensured that we had an excellent stay in Marina bay sands.",July 2022,80,5.0
Moe the ICON of MBS ü§©,I travelled with my best friend to Singapore in July for a week and we decided to spoil ourselves and stay at the beautiful Marina Bay Sands hotel. On the 57th floor was the ICONIC infinity pool that had the most amazing views. During our stay we met the very entertaining lifeguard Moe. He honestly made our stay so much fun. Moe was there every day to greet us with a smile and fluff our sun bed pillows üòÇ We would joke and livestream so all our family and friends would join in the fun and Moe became the face of our social media lives and so he got the name ICON MOE of MBS ü§©If you are looking for a great time away with 10 ‚≠êÔ∏è service Moe will give you a fun holiday to remember. All our family and friends can‚Äôt wait to meet Moe üòç,July 2022,1,5.0
What a stunner,"Wow what an amazing experience. We had booked an orchard suite for 1 night and the hotel went over and above our expectations. Right from check in where we were met by Jasmine and taken to the lounge to check in we knew this was going to be a great time.We were early so took a look around the shoppes shopping mall and was then called when our room was ready.  Our main contact Mac took us to the room and we were blown away by the views and standard of the room.We then visited the infinity pool which was incredible.We then decided to book another night at MBS, due to the upcoming national holiday the suite was not available but Mac sorted it so we had a premium room and he arranged for all of our luggage to be transferred while we visited gardens by the bay.  He took us to our new room and had arranged gifts for us and our children.The hotel is super clean and the TV‚Äôs are massive in the rooms. We would come back again next time we are in Singapore.",August 2022,198,5.0

Marina Bay Sands,"The infinity pool is awesome. I recommend the first time to visit the pool at dark, it is just amazing. At sunset is very crowded and in my opinion it is even more impressive in the dark and there is not much going on. From the rooms I was unfortunately a little disappointed, you pay the high price only for the pool, the rest of the hotel is below the renowned 5 star competition.The associated shopping center is also spectacular and one of the largest I have ever seen. Small travel hack in the in-house casino you get drinks, cigarettes and more for free.",May 2022,79,4.0
Best time at this hotel! Pool was the highlight of trip!,"Staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore was amazing! I must say the pool was without a doubt the highlight for my family. Not only was the view breathtaking  and service great but Moe ,one of the lifeguards ,made it one of the most memorable stays I think we‚Äôll ever have. He instantly made sure we had everything we needed, helped take pictures of us and was so helpful in giving us information about the area. We looked forward to seeing him every day we went to the pool!. We can‚Äôt wait to go back to see Moe!! What a terrific, kind human being!! You all are very lucky to have him!

Great Views and Great Staff,"Booked 2 rooms due to large family and Stayed over the New Year break. Fantastic views from the room. The staff were excellent all the way down to housekeeping. Special call out to my attendant who topped up kids drinks in our mini bar when he saw our horde of munchkins.View from Pool was incredible as was all the food there in general. I would point out to any one trying to stay there over peak periods to book early. This includes dining reservations. Up to a week prior to my stay, all restaurants were already booked out - totally my own fault for not thinking further ahead. On the upside, the room service is incredible and serves pretty much 24 hrs.Would come back for sure.",December 2021,4,5.0

Every detail is just so well thought of, staff are customer oriented. I am very impressed and will definitely return to stay if I‚Äôm back in Singapore. Even the lifeguard Ryan was so proactive to help us take family photos. If there is a slight improvement needed, it would be Stella from the infinity pool service team, she could have been more polite to ask and check with her other colleagues instead of brushing us aside when we said we did not receive the QR code for the swimming pool booking.

The quality of service was excellent. Special thanks to Mustika in the reception lounge who made my stay more than wonderful!Marina Bay surprised me in very good way, You will find more than just spectacular views.

We were taken to our room - the veiw across the city was brilliant. The room was tidy and clean. The bathroom and bath tub were excellent. We booked a pool slot for the day time and lifeguard Moe was very friendly and helpful. We were able to book an evening slot for the pool too (really recommend doing this if you can) and Leo was the pool attendant at night. Again very helpful and friendly.

Service over & above the rest!,"I am writing this mail to compliment the amazing set of crew at the infinity pool. The service rendered to me was out of this world. I would like to particularly compliment LIFEGUARD KELVIN for providing service over and above the rest. He was extremely helpful and had a lot of initiative. He continuously kept checking on all of the hotel guests‚Äô safety & comfort. Staff like him should be recognized rendering such top quality service from his heart. He took pride in his work. He is definitely an asset to the company. Thanks to this wonderful set of crew, I truly enjoyed my experience with your hotel and am definitely coming back and sharing my experience on all social media platforms.

Fantastic experience! Highly recommended!,"This was our second stay in MBS, however, I couldn't post a review previously as we had to cut our stay short due to my baby falling sick.This time, we had a staycation for 4D3N during CNY2022 and it's lovely experience.The moment you enter hotel premises, you're made to feel why MBS is worth the hype and more!Check-in process was smooth despite the large crowd & the staff members ensured everyone is well attended to. We proceeded to our room and the luggage arrived soon after.Room size was good enough. Very clean and pleasant with a beautiful view from the balcony. All the amenities are high quality and well maintained. Loved the bathroom :)Services are pretty quick and the concierge/room service respond to calls in almost no time. Very impressive, considering the hotel was almost full capacity.I was overjoyed to see plenty of options in breakfast for my dietary requirements (vegetarian, allergic to eggs) and they're delicious! The breakfast place is very well maintained with nice & warm staffs. They're very helpful in adjusting to my baby's mood who went bit noisy & started dropping cutlery at one point. Thanks for that and apologies for the inconvenience.In-room dining service is bit expensive but quality is good with adequate portions. They serve within the stipulated time. No delays. We also explored the infinity pool and observation deck, and both are totally worth the praise. We've been to observation deck couple of times earlier as well, however, infinity pool was just second time as it's limited only for hotel guests.We can't wait enough to book another staycation with MBS as it never ceases to amaze us with its grandeur and services which is world class.Kudos to the team! You're doing a wonderful job!!",January 2022,97,5.0
Heavenly Stay at the Top,"Despite the size and scale of its operations, I never had to wait in line or queue for very long. I guess having been in operation since 2010 has allowed for improvements over the years. The check-in process was a breeze, and I was only at the front desk for less than 7 minutes when I was handed my key; and off I went. Being an avid cyclist, the fact that I could store my bicycle was a definite plus!What struck me the most as I entered the room was the enormity of it. The hotel did not stinge on space for their rooms. My room was well maintained, with guest amenities aplenty. I would have liked for a bottle of mouthwash though, and one or two of the electrical sockets did not seem to work well. I had to press down my phone changer plug to get it connected. But these were minor issues and I did not let them ruin my stay. The chatbot was a great help attending to my enquiries, especially with the booking of the pool slots and the numerous dining options.",April 2022,756,5.0
"MBS a ""must stay"" destination","Our 20th yr. anniversary, we wanted to ""go big"" and chose Dubai and Singapore to stay. Both places were great, but MBS outshined everything we hoped for. from the staff to the amenities everything was top notched. City was clean and healthy, as was the hotel.

Marina Bay Pre-Departure Testing,Do not go there for pre-departure test if you want to avoid headache stress and hassle. better queue at GP or elsewhere will be worth the trip as this mini booth at convention center for pre-departure test will anyway keep you waiting too long and get the info on your documents wrong,April 2022,1,1.0
"Comment as promised, fr. Bere to Moe","Stayed one night in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, room was amazing: spacious, clean, comfortable bed and huge bathtub. As I booked at the counter and mentioned that I would leave early in the morning, they gave me a room at the upper level, with beautiful view. Of course I went to the infinity pool; as it was early in the morning, there were few people and I could enjoy the pool and also meet Mr. Moe, with who I shared interesting conversation about Singapore and traveling the world. Breakfast at the Spago was delicious, I recommend Asian food.",April 2022,1,4.0

Great Staff...Must Visit Mr. Moe at The Pool,"As a solo traveler visiting Singapore for the first time I must say my MBS experience was its amazing.  The Room and the surrounding views are 2nd to none and the staff were great; in particular lifeguard Mr. Moe.  Moe is ""True Service"",  someone who deeply cares about other peoples experiences, someone whos kindness shows in everything he does.  Moe always made sure I was taken care of, be it by the pool or with his advise on sites to see while in Singapore.

Ok bang for big buck!,"As expected everything about marina bay sands is grand including its prices! Considering the high price you pay to stay there, customer service is patchy and inconsistent (from very good service most of the time to less than mediocre service some of the time). Security in accessing the Casino is more heightened (a little overkill) than immigration security at the airport! The infinity pool was nice and free ice cream was a plus (despite the pool being crowded due to school holidays). The free light show at the marina was spectacular (truly immersive and breathtaking). The floating apple store nearby was fun. If you can stay there without breaking the bank it‚Äôs worth it. The hotel room was nicely stocked and comfortable!",June 2022,6,4.0
Amazing,"Amazing!!  There is not a thing out of place at this hotel!  Staff throughout were attentive and extremely helpful.  At the front desk we missed our appointed check in time, but we‚Äôre ushered through to check in anyway at the front desk.  The lady there was very helpful and took us through all the perks/features of the hotel.  Make sure you sign up for the MBS rewards card before you go so you can get the points.  Make sure you scan it everytime you go shopping or dine in.  The rewards are well worth it.  At the Infinity Pool we had Moe play photographer (his one of the many lifesavers). Then throughout the day they hand out free ice creams and juices.  I love that there is a adults only section of the infinity pool.  Plenty of staff on offer if you wish to purchase food or drinks.   Only down side is that the bar/food closes early.  But you can access the pool until later.  Housekeeping are amazing!  Leaving little treats for us throughout our week long stay.  Staying here was definitely an experience that I fully appreciated and will never forget.",June 2022,52,5.0
An experience to remember!,"If this is your first time to Singapore, staying here is a must. It is expensive but it‚Äôs worth the money. If you want to save money, go through Booking.com, but the rooms you‚Äôll get will be the lower floors and least desirable. If you book directly with the hotel, you may get the better rooms. I would double check both sites first to compare the rates before you book.Now, let‚Äôs talk about the hotel. It‚Äôs iconic and the most beautiful hotel in the city. The location is unbeatable. You can literally spend a week there if you could afford it. There‚Äôs three main towers connected by a long lobby on the bottom and the infinity pool on top. You have to be a guest in order to use the infinity pool.  The hotel is connected by two underground walkways to a shopping complex that has many stores, a food court, restaurants, theater, art museum and casino. The casino has no entrance fee if you‚Äôre a visitor so you need to present a passport. To discourage locals from gambling, they charge $150 entrance fee for locals.The entire is part of the Marina Bay Sands. It‚Äôs huge! The food court has very good food. Think of it as a food stand except it‚Äôs a lot cleaner. The price is also a bit more expensive compared to the food hawker center in the city. There‚Äôs high end restaurants in here as well. Expect to pay over $150 per person for dinner. The location is unbeatable. You can walk across a bridge to get to Garden by the Bay. Early in the morning when it‚Äôs less hot and humid, you can walk around the bay to the Fullerton Hotel.The rooms are nice and the service is impeccable. Our room was serviced twice a day. They even offer free water bottles. Everything is so clean and the people are super nice! The best part is not just the pool, but the experience of staying there. The vibe is up eating and you can just feel like you‚Äôre in the moment by staying here. I would definitely come back here again.We did have an issue with our check in but I won‚Äôt lower the ratings because that would not be fair. We had 2 rooms near each other on the fifth floor for an early check in at around 9:45am. We were told that we can wait until a higher level is available for 2 rooms. They said they can‚Äôt say what level, but it would be higher than the fifth floor. Would you be tempted by this offer? Well, our temptations got the best of us and we agreed, only to realize fifteen minutes that we would be room less until 4pm and where are we going to store our luggages and change our clothes even if we want to swimming? Within fifteen minutes, we came back ti the front desk and said that we would want one if the room in the fifth floor and wait for the second room. They said that the room on the 5th floor is no longer available, and they only have the 4th floor available. Sure, we take it since we were going yo get a room on the higher floor anyway. Later on, around 2pm? we checked back and they have room ready for us. We were excited. They gave us a higher room than the fifth floor like they said. They gave us a room on the 6th floor. I kid you not! I can‚Äôt believe a high end hotel that prides itself in customer service would actually offer a guest to give up 2 rooms on the 5th floor that‚Äôs ready for an early check in so that they can wait without a room for another four hours and can get a higher room on the 6th floor! I felt like I was part of some comedy show where the joke was on me. Or it was an important lesson to be happy with what you have instead of taking an offer for something better? I didn‚Äôt know MBS offers life lessons as well?",June 2022,79,5.0
Amazing and not to be missed!,"We stayed for 4 nights in Orchard Suite. Overall we had an amazing experience and staff were outstanding! We were very well looked after by the staff,  who even left us a nice welcome surprise in our room as they were aware we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. It is a busy hotel and at times you will have to queue but this is expected when you staying at 2000+ room hotel! The staff did an amazing job to look after us and room and food choice was excellent.  We used Club 55 which is definitely worth the upgrade and never had any lunch as we were so full up with afternoon tea and evening drinks. The complimentary water/juices/ice cream at infinity pool is a nice touch and again staff went out of their way to ensure you had a wonderful experience in the pool area. Definitely use the jacuzzi!! The pool was busy on weekend but very quiet on weekdays. Lots of reviews complain about queues?? Not sure what they expect when they are visiting one of the largest hotels in the world?? You have many boutique hotels in Singapore- so stay there! Also the hotel staff encouraged guests to try and avoid breakfast between 8.30am and 9.30am as this was peak period. We always had breakfast around 8am and only queued once. Again weekend breakfast was busier than weekday. The hotel is walking distance to many attractions and the MRT station can be accessed from the hotel. The MRT Line that serves the station - also serves Little India and Haji Lane. The other 2 main destinations of Chinatown and Orchard Lane are only a few stops away from the hotel (have to change once). The connected shopping mall has lots of high end shops as well as many food choices. I would recommend taking a walk around the marina and visiting the Hawker food court that is next to outside theatre - food was amazing and a lot cheaper than the restaurants in the mall. Lastly a huge thank you to Shataz Ho (premium service/front desk) who was absolutely amazing throughout our stay. We will definitely be back to stay at this wonderful and amazing hotel!!",June 2022,2,5.0
"The pool and hot jacuzzi are awesome! Nice view, good music!","Room is big, bathroom very spacious. The infinity pool is the best of course! But it looks best on a sunny day.

A must do,"This hotel is a must do in Singapore because of it‚Äôs amazing pool and the views. We had 2 rooms, one on 21st floor and one on 48th floor and both had the harbour view. I would totally recommend them over the city view rooms. Not only I think that the garden/harbour view is simply nicer but also because they have balconies which is amazing in the evenings as you can look at the many ships and the gardens by the bay. The lower floor room had a really big balcony and a super close view of the light and music show in the gardens. The upper floor room had a small balcony so could only stand there or alternatively sit in the room with the doors open. Both were great for different reasons. If I could have any negative comment then I wasn‚Äôt too impressed with the bed. It was rather on the small side (definitely not king size) and not really comfortable. The toiletries in the bathroom smelt divine on the other hand! The highlight of course is the lovely pool with panoramic views and we were there for hours during the days and in the evenings. It was a bit crowded at times but still totally worth a visit. I would absolutely stay again. It‚Äôs pricey especially as it‚Äôs room only. For comparison we stayed in a different hotel in Singapore which is also lovely, centrally located and we paid 20% less for a much larger and nicer room with panoramic views. The hotel also had a lovely infinity pool with gorgeous views of the city including MBS and the price included a generous breakfast and afternoon snacks/cocktails. Of course the pool wasn‚Äôt anywhere near as big or iconic as the one in MBS but also lovely and more intimate. Overall I would definitely return to both.",June 2022,117,5.0
View from the rooms is to die for.,"The hotel is huge and connected to a mall. The best part of the hotel is its infinity pool on the 57th floor, the view is just breath taking. We took the city side rooms and it was a great view from the room. The room size is also good for the price you pay. This is the first hotel i have experienced where even kids had their individual key card. Kids felt special when they got their own key cards. the sofa cum bed dint have the best comfort, but was ok. they should have provided with a little more thicker beds. We would feel the springs in the sofa cum beds. The main beds were very comfortable. No complains there.",June 2022,49,4.0
Luxury,Treated like a queen and king from the moment we walked in.  The room over looked the gardens and was huge.  Please if you stay book into restaurants before you get there the first night we were there we couldn‚Äôt get in anywhere and most restaurants were booked out for a few days.  However the room service menu was amazing had one of the best dinners in our room.  The shops of course are 5 star so make sure you have money.  In all it was a Great experience and would stay again,June 2022,5,5.0
Brilliant stay!,Had a brilliant time from start to finish. Room was stunning - 53rd floor overlooking the gardens was really worth it. Staff were super helpful and friendly. Pool was as amazing as all the pictures. So many hotels in Singapore but definitely recommend this one! It was much busier at the weekend so if you can stay mid-week it would make it perfect.,May 2022,24,5.0
Family friendly resort feel more than 5 star luxury,"We have always wanted to stay here after seeing the beautiful photos of the pool and building. The property is huge and on the pricey side. We upgraded to a harbor view room which had a lovely view. The room itself was nothing special and did show signs of wear, but was clean. They provided lots if bottled water in the room which was nice. The pools view is as spectacular as you see in photos, BUT what they don‚Äôt show you is how crowded it actually is with screaming splashing children alllllll over (not just in the children‚Äôs pool) . Because of this we stayed mostly in the small adults only area which was on one of the far corners of the pool. The restaurants by the pool all require a dress code, men collar shirts and no sandals, pool wear not allowed which we found odd since they are in the pool area.There were lines for almost everything in the hotel also which we didn‚Äôt care for. The service was very good and everyone was very nice, but we prefer a more personal feel in a hotel when traveling. We are happy we tried it, but would definitely not stay here again. We were wanting a 5 star luxury experience and it felt more like a family resort.",June 2022,6,3.0
Moe is the best,"I stayed at marina bay sand while I was visiting the pool, I met Moe the lifeguard and I asked him to take some pictures for me not only he was very pleasant and he also took the best pictures for my husband and I.

Clearly impressive view & rooftop pool BUT besides that you will be treated like a mass tourist not 5* guest,"+ Amazing pool & rooftop view+ even lowest price room really beautiful and amazing view- Check in was a bit like ordering in MC Donalds and has nothing to do with a 5* hotel: harsh welcome in the lobby guiding us to the so called ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù check in, there you have to wait in a queue up and wait w/o seating option, we have been sitting with 2 kods on the stone stairs‚Ä¶ (what we are used to in 5* hotels is being seated in a nice area, someone picking up the passports and checkin in for us while we enjoy our free welcome drinks)- Service around the pool really poor: took us sometimes 15 min or more to get the attention of a waiter, food (burger & salad) took > 45mins and when we ordered extra mayonaose for the fries they dis not manage to brong before food was cold- be aware that there is a strict checkout at 12 and you are not allowed to prolong or stay on the pool the day! Since there is also not really a lobby area where you could stay you cannot stay anywhere if your flight is later on the day and the hotel also does not care- Breakfast was not close to what you would expect in a 5* hotel e.g.: no fresh juices available at the buffet (only for extra payment), some items are served in one-time plastic buckets same as you would have in a cheap fast food restaurant (e.g. pre-mixed Bircher M√ºsli, sauces)To summarize: unfortunately you will only find this view/rooftop pool on this hotel, bit otherwise not really worth the price!",July 2022,35,3.0
Fun Holiday,Holidaying at Marina Bay Sands with our granddaughter was fun and relaxing. Nice room with majestic city view. Adjacent to Garden by the Bay and shopping mall. Friendly and courteous staffs. Thanks to Belle and Ryan being hispitable and helpfull. Breakfast was good and fresh and delicious.

After hours (10pm) it dies a death,"First time here, blown away by what I saw, suppose the moon would be the same but after 10 mins you see it for what it is. Casino, nightmare to even enter and the staff are like tailors dummies, no personality or wit. Room service eh had to wait 30 mins for them to call me back...didn't so I kept calling back. Told me to order a Grab if I needed quick service.Basically nice for one night then take a few months to get over the cash you gave them and hopefully after 10 years you only remember the good bit",July 2022,10,1.0
Vegas meets Disney,"Massive place crossed between Las Vegas and Disney, hard to get any personal service it‚Äôs crazy busy, the pool is stunning but manic and not relaxing at all it‚Äôs busy, noisy, all laid out in long lines with most people saving beds and not using them. Queues at every restaurant from early morning to late at night. It‚Äôs an exhausting experience. Concierge are so very helpful they really do make a difference. Rooms are pretty basic at most levels, views over bay are nice and interesting. Garden views are cool for the light show every night.",July 2022,14,3.0
What a fabulous place,"It‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs brash and it‚Äôs beautiful. We stayed on the 51st floor for a couple of nights and the room and views were superb.We didn‚Äôt use a huge amount of the hotel amenities but the infinity pool is spectacular and well worth staying at the hotel for.Transfer from Changi is quick by taxi and pretty reasonably priced and would recommend as a low stress option.

MBS a luxurious destination,"We are a family of 6 ( my 85 yearold father, 79 year old mother, my sis-in-law and his sons flew in from Canada and myself ),the room upgrade (Merlion Suite facing gardens by the bay)was very much appreaciated!My 2 nephews flew in from Canada and were celebratin their birthday as well, so having us all in 1 room was a big surprise as well as  the complimentary cakes.The suite was of course luxurious, the complimentary tea, coffee, drinks and chocolates were a big hit.Booking is simple online, the check-in process could be improve especially for the unintiated like where do we look for the queue numbers although 1 unpleasant encounter was when a guest claimed that our queue number was his and proceeded to the counter , I was baffled as the prompt in my phone stated my check-in was completed already while we are still queueing  up behind the counter. I needed to asked for help for this and turned out the guest claimed he has our queue number, the receptionist just proceeded to check him in without counter-checking like asked him to show the queue number from his phone. Anyway, the staff whom I called for help come to out rescue and all is good again.I am also gratefull that the wheelchair I requested for my 85 year old father was sent straight to the room, should‚Äôve asked for my 79 year old mother as well If I only knew it would be easy to request.The room service butler was very responsive and the staffs sent to us for assistance for our needs were very respectful, knowledgeable and attentive , kudos to Leah( room -in dining dinner, very promptly she set up our table and has very friendly attitue)Cecil( gave the surprise cakes , she is very amicable and friendly)Nadrajan( our first contact after check-in, he asked if the wheelchair will be used at that time or we prefer to send in to our room and before he left the room he distinctly explained about what butler phone can do,the key cards although he explaine the electricity card but we cannot find the slot he was saying) ,the guy who brought our ice cubes whom I failed to get his name and the one who enlightened us about the electricity acrd which our room does not need to use it,the guy who brought in our breakfast but I failed to get his nameLaura from Infinity pool whom you can tell her sincerity in making sure we are taken cared of , she asked Leo to assist my dad and mom while they are visiting the pool. One not so good experience was during breakfast when we went down to RISE restaurant , our 2 rooms originally booked does not include breakfast but from what Mary staff from check in told us that we can go to RISE or SPAGO for breakfast without reservation, so when we queued up the staff from RISE asked for my name and room number and when she checked our original room has no inclusion of breakfast but I asked if we can still eat and pay , she said no so we just went back to our room and ordered in for room service. I called and checked why we were sent away, the phone butler staff checked then called again and claimed there was no record we approached RISE eventhough restaurant staff asked to spell out my name and after awhile called us to head down with already a table reserved for us but I declined since we already ordered for breakfast room service. I failed to get the RISE staff‚Äôs name as we were  already flustered, anyway we moved on after that since we have the breakfast in our room already and proceeded to the Infinity pool, of course the reason we booked at MBS was the pool and we were not disappointed , from the booking for the date slot and the messages sent whether the pool is temporarily closed because of the inclement weather as well as its opening once available is very much helpful and as I mentioned Laura from the Infinity pool is a darling, she is very sincere. The photo also was an experience, the photographer was friendly and does not impose, it‚Äôs nice that other than the printed photos, the digital photos were available to the guests. Check-out was easy as can check out from the TV although as 2 rooms initially was booked only  1 room was billed and able to check out from the TV so needed to check put from the front desk , Victor helped us out from the front desk to check out and settle our bill for our stay. The Merlion suite of course has the wow factor already its spacious and clean,the furnitures are comfortable, the mini bar was well equipped, the toilet in the bathroom can have a bidet perhaps , the bathtub is super comfy, the massage room and the hair washing room does not come with any information how to use it though , the downside of staying in the Merlion Suite is we almost refused  to leave the room. The overall experience we had was very memorable, and yes we will come and check-in again",July 2022,95,5.0

Our Stay at Marina Bay Sands (April 2022 Rm# 4670),"Eileen of Guest Services from Marina Bay Sands is cool, helpful and kind! Always there to help and help! I appreciate her when she made me feel good when I encountered a not so kind Guest Services Officer of Marina Bay upon checking in. Then again when my battery is almost empty after I came from Singapore International Water Week 2022, she lend me her pwerbank and eventually gave it to me. Eileen is constantly willing to help. I think that‚Äôs her nature and her job is suited for her. I would like also to comment for Michelle, their Front Desk Manager, the 2nd person I met upon checkin. Super super kind and helpful too! She‚Äôs very knowledgeable in her field. She assisted me all the way until we settled and get our room. Also Rj in Front Desk is super kind the 3rd person I met in Marina Bay Sands is super super kind too! Shouting out for these wonderful people, including Ramesh and Xavier of Front Desk the wonderful people I met eventually on our Stay there. Also Wee Hong and all the people from Infinity Pool and Liang the photographer. I would like also to shoutout the people we encountered in Spago, Mark the German from Rise and others(sorry I forgot their names) and Club 55. Thank you to them.

Friendliest lifeguard I have met,"The stay itself was very pleasant and amazing, not to mention the fantastic hospitality and brightness of the staff. Especially a lifeguard by the infinity pool, Moe. He's extremely friendly and is more than willing to snap pictures for you. Not to mention, the shots he takes look as if a professional photographer had taken it. He also knows every good spot to take those pictures at, so don't worry about ideas of places to take photos! Moe was also very helpful and happy to assist all the time with a huge smile plastered on his face. You can easily strike up a conversation with him and he would be more than glad to share more about Marina Bay Sands.

Fun vibe and great pool,First time in Singapore and we had a blast. Concierge staff (especially Xavier and Jen) were amazing.

Service unparalleled,"Friendly staff throughout our staff, from entering the hotel a lady who was checking for Tracetogether checkin helped me register and showed me what to do to speed up the check in process (which I will need to be doing everywhere I go in Singapore).Checkin process is a efficient as they had virtual queue in which you put down your name and number then it will notify you once you're ready to be served (so you are able to browse around or sit down somewhere nearby without standing in line). We didn't have a SG number so we were standing infant of the numbering machine waiting. I had a few questions about Singapore and where I could get sims/travel cards etc so I asked Joseph who was there assisting guests to get a virtual queue number. It was a quiet time so there was nobody except for us and Joseph patiently answered all our queries cracking a joke every now and then which made the waiting a lot shorter! We also had a little complain which we ranted to him about, without telling us he went and did what he could to help us resolve the issue which made our stay 110% better as we know we were in good hands.When leaving we had to collect our luggage from the concierge as we had it stored when checking out, Imad or Iman (apologies for forgetting) assisted us to collect our luggage. He then asked us how we were leaving and remembered the plate number by repeating it multiple times of the car picking us up. He then waited with us to ensure that as soon as the car came he could asks his colleagues and help us get our luggage in the car. Definitely not part of his job to do that but the extra level of care and service he provided made us felt warm leaving MBS. PS. Pool was amazing and there weren't as many people as we were expecting (8:50-10:05 time)! very very enjoyable experience. Thank you again Joseph, Imad and the team at MBS",April 2022,3,5.0

She said yes!,"We stayed during the good friday weekend, the place was crowded but we never had to wait for more than 10 minutes to be serviced. Breakfast queue was long, but we were acknowledged by the F&B staff which is appreciated.Booked the hotel to propose to my girlfriend and the concierge team were legends. I will like to give acknowledgement to Alan. I was due to check in on friday and I went down to the hotel on Thursday to make plans with the team. Alan made sure to keep the large bouquet of roses I bought were safe. He even went the extra step to find a place where it could be stored in the fridge for me.On arrival, some plans changed and I texted him (secretly) to see if he could place the items in room whilst I stall her at the check-in counter. Sure enough, he made it happen. We went up to the room and it was displayed nicely for her eyes to see.Proposal went smooth, and Alan event sent a bottle of Champagne for us to celebrate the occasion. Legends.As an ex hotelier, I am very impressed by the seamless service that was provided by Marina Bay Sands. In room dining was good too, the staff made us feel like we were dining in the restaurant when he presented us with our food.10/10 would return. Maybe for our wedding anniversaries. heheThank You so much to MBS, Alan and Team.

Way Overpriced,"Way overpriced for what you get. Don‚Äôt get me wrong the view of the pool was amazing but without that the hotel is nothing. Was ¬£1000 for one night, and not worth it.

That was very disappointing. The room wasn‚Äôt wow, which for that amount of money was also very disappointing. We spent most of our time at the infinity sky pool which was amazing but the only amazing thing of our stay.

But without fail, my companion, Maria, would return with our coffee saying how nice Linda at the front counter was to her. This happened every morning.

Very expensive to stay here - you don‚Äôt get the ambience that you expect,We stayed at Marina Bay for 3 nights - 26/29 Aug Hotel is very busy -  they have trouble coping with the number of guests - we had to wait 40 minutes to check in. The hotel is very expensive - $8.00 for a coke - $18.00 for a Heineken - $55.00 each for breakfast - dinner buffet in excess of $100 each We tried to book restaurants on the 57th floor - there are 4 - I think - every restaurant was booked out for dinner - for the next 3 nights of our stay I think 1 restaurant offered a table at 10.00pm !!I suggested to the hotel that guests paying nearly $900 a night - should be advised to book the restaurants in advance of their stay so they are not disappointed.Prior to arrival - the hotel advised you need to book a time for the swimming pool each day - I though this unusual - and it did make me doubt how good our stay was going to be. On arrival - reception advised you don‚Äôt have to book a time !The swimming pool on the 57th floor was the highlight - it is the main attraction at Marina Bay - it is magnificent - and a wonderful experience. But that is it - that is what you are paying nearly a $900 night  for - remove the swimming pool and it‚Äôs just another overpriced high rise hotel with a view over Singapore.Staff are excellent - cleaning of the rooms was very prompt - bathroom was a little larger than normal  - bedroom had a HUGE TV - but otherwise a standard size room.Hotel was far too busy with people everywhere - people queueing to have breakfast  - certainly not the ambience I was paying for !Both my wife and I were glad to leave the hotel and would never go back - it‚Äôs ok to pay more than normal when staying in a premium hotel - but it was excessive - and made us feel uncomfortable - like the hotel was gauging as much as they could while we were staying there.,August 2022,12,2.0
Great service and the infinity pool was worth it!,"The service at the hotel was great and attentive; I had a wonderful welcome gift from the hotel. However, at the price of almost $1000 dollars a night that should be pretty standard. The pool was wonderful to experience and it is great that there was no time limit. It was not crowded at all and enjoyed the pool as well as the hot tubs overlooking the ships.

A lot more work is needed in making guests feel like they are in-fact staying in the best hotel in Singapore.

Excellent Staycation for celebrations!,"We checked in at MBS on 26th Feb and we are very pleased with the entire experience. Right upon arrival, we were graciously welcomed by Mr Ramesh and I had an excellent experience checking in at my designated time. I would like to thank Ms Lecia at the front desk who assisted me with a pleasant check-in experience and a wonderful room at Tower 2 on the 45th floor facing the Gardens and Harbour view. My mom was very pleased with the spacious room and we are truly appreciative of the scenic views especially at night with all the lights from Gardens by The Bay! I would also like to extend our heartfelt appreciation for the wonderful birthday cakes delivered to the room, it was indeed a touching gesture. Thank you to the excellent bell-hop services too and we appreciate the assistance from arrival to departure with our luggage; special thanks to Mr Marvin & Mr Philip who assisted us with our luggage to & from our rooms, thank you to Mr Shasi, Mr Suresh and Mr Abdul Majid too at the Lobby who helped us with our luggage off and on our ride back home. We felt the ohana vibes and we will definitely be regular visitors for future celebrations and staycations at MBS. For guests who are considering to stay at this hotel, please sign up for the Sands Rewards Lifestyle card too.

Fun Staycation,"Staycation was memorable.  We got a Premier room on the 37th floor, with a bathtub and a city view.Pros:- Great views from room, and a good size too.- Excellent and warm service by all, from concierge to housekeeping.  A shoutout to the pool staff who were friendly and helped make each swim enjoyable, no matter what time of day.- Bathtub in room, and some complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the minibar.- Infinity pool was wonderful. We were there three times, at sunrise, evening and late evening.  Loved the jacuzzi too.  Good that only hotel guests can use this as it cuts down on numbers in the pool.  Also, you can book a daily timeslot, which is great.- Easy access to Gardens By The Bay, and MRT at doorstep (we did not use this)- Access to food options within the building, or just over at the Gardens.  But not all the food was that great.Cons:  .- Room was dated, with mold in the bathroom.  They are renovating rooms in Tower 2 currently.- Housekeeping can be improved.  Dust in bathroom ceiling and room carpets.- Shower area does not drain fully, and you need to use the feet to push the water towards the rain area. Otherwise, could become slippery and cause guest to slip.- Funky smell in lift lobby area, so much so that they had to run an ozone machine for a couple of days.- Wait for lifts from room floors can take a while especially around meal times when diners head to the restaurants at the rooftop.Tip:  If you drive, you can park at the Shoppes area, but only for one exit.

A+++ on service,"2nd time staying here (last time being 5+ years ago) and still amazing even during a pandemic. - Check-in process is cleverly covid-safe designed to stagger people so no crowding in the lobby. You book a time slot and can track when it's your turn to approach a counter online. - Sky Infinity Pool access is no longer unlimited time, COVID era unfortunately however it is super safe with guests needing to book a time slot in advance. each time slot session ends they clean the area for the next lot of guests. Capped guest limit is a blessing in disguise, so much easier to take photos and have a swim now! - Super attentive service by all staff we encountered or walked past in the hallways. Also came to us with a cake as it was our anniversary. Wow factorNote that there is currently construction work in the middle tower from what I could see so some unlucky guests might hear noise but we were in tower 1 (L26) so did not hear any construction. No hotel in Australia comes close.",February 2022,78,5.0

Nice stay at Marina Bay Sands,"It is my 2nd visit to MBS hotel.The environment seemed relaxed at lobby ,as well as lift area where there were no Social Distancing Ambassadors ( I nicknamed them Red Guards) manning entrance of the lifts of Tower 1,2 and 3.I am totally impressed by the hotel efficiency, really world class!I booked a room in Dec 2021, for Feb 2022 stay, I also order afternoon tea set in Dec 2021.few hours before I go to hotel, I received SMS telling me to arrive at hotel in specific time and tower .I went to the hotel lobby at about 1.50pm.Stand for a while and wait for my Queue Number to be called.Check in was effortless and receptionist told me that my afternoon tea set will be delivered to my room in 20 minutes or so.(thats efficient )25 minutes later, afternoon tea set arrived¬† and it was 2 tier -sandwiches and sweet savouries .I brewed coffee from Coffee machine.There, I was having meal and coffee in room, overlooking the nice view of harbour, and the sea..I know why this hotel is hot favourite during National Day because military aircrafts fly pass the bay area which hotel is located.Then rest in bed till 4.45pm.. Getting ready for swimming pool at 5.20pm, after contacting Room service for evening turndown and collection of food tray from my room.I went to Level 57, and it was 5.10 pm.Thus, I went to area where I admired the view of sea and cold breeze.After that I went to check in at swimming pool area, I walked along the path where¬† I pick the place near towel collection area, and placed my towel, clothes and went to swim. (quite comfortable, no crowded ,Thus, I swim to the side where I can see the buildings ( I recognised some of them ) and sea.Then swim to and fro¬† few¬† times, then do underwater exercise.Then rest at chair, looking around.. There are staffs in white uniform , red , and blue uniform.White uniform staffs in charge of towels - providing guests towel, and rescue guest if he has issues. (white uniform with red cross)Red uniform - Social Distancing Ambassadors.Blue uniform - bar staffs serving cocktails and drinks, bar foods.Time almost up. I went back to room and bathe and head to MBS mall to do window shopping, and observe the food court , restaurants- full of activites.Then went back to hotel , heading to Origin¬†+ Bloom cafe intending to order bread, hot chocolate, and fruits.Unfortunately, food and drink items not available, and thus I take fruits and went back to hotel room ,and eat fruits , watch my favourite local drama on TVThen surf net on my laptop till it was time to sleepI look at sea at night... it was beautiful sight..Morning, woke up.and book a gym slot at Level 55, Tower 2.¬†Reply come almost immediateI then took lift down to level 1 lobby and then cross over to Tower 2 and then took lift to Level 55.I was impressed by the classy gym area.Social distancing are strictly observed and there are partion¬†in between at gym machines.I began work out at cardio area for 20 mins, before moving to another gym machines.Time almost up, at 8 am.Take note when book a gym. You cannot book slot in advance unlike swimming pool.When you send SMS to Gym, you are given slot to go to gym in 15 minutes time immediately..I went down to level 1 and then cross over to Tower 3 ,and took lift up.Reaching my room, I took wallet and MBS membership card to go to Raspura¬†Masters for breakfast where I had dim sum , kopi and fruit platter for less than $20.To Hotel Management: take note : there are a lot of scams involving Marina Bay Sands- membership scam, casino scam..There are also room scam and Club 55 voucher scam.Room scam- there is a lot of ads on MBS room - deluxe room advertise at cheaper price , less than $300 per night..¬†There are club room and grand club room scam where agents will deal with MBS staff to allocate booking of rooms for extra fees.Club 55 voucher - agents will give you voucher where you get free breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails if you pay such agents $80.In reality, Hotel is under intensive renovation at some areas where club rooms / grand room clubs are located. Thus all club room and grand club rooms are closed. and there are no such things as Club 55 vouchers. (hotel manager told me this few months ago when I made enquiry.)Will come and stay in hotel again when free.",February 2022,126,5.0

Contented Guests,"My son and I had a staycation at your hotel recently.  We did not quite have a good experience with your front office staff and we sort of were disappointed that we received such a reception at a renowned hotel like MBS.After lugging our luggage to our allocated room, we headed for the pool without much of an expectation from the staff.  Upon our arrival at the pool, we were pleasantly greeted by a Mr Moe, the lifeguard.  He was such a jewel who changed our perspective of the hotel.Mr Moe was pro-active in everything he did. He ensured not only me and my son, but everyone at the pool were well taken care of and had a good time.  He took the initiative to show us around for the best location for photos and volunteered to take photos for us.  He was careful while doing so, the rest of the hotel guests were not neglected.  He was jovial, very approachable and professional all the time. We can sense his sincerity in ensuring everyone had an enjoyable time despite at times he seemed busy.  His service was impeccable. I would say he was very passionate with his job.  Mr Moe had such a magic touch that my son loves him so much that he is bugging me to bring him back someday to be entertained by Mr Moe again and most probably I will.     Finally, I would like to mention the restaurants served wonderfully curated dishes with well trained staff too.  The room we had had a nice view of Gardens by the Bay and the night view from the pool was beyond words.  Overall, the initial dismay was compensated.",June 2022,1,5.0
2 nights stay at the iconic Marina Bay Sands,"My family and I spent 2 nights at the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel, and were not disappointed. The rooms were exquisite, and the views from Spago and the pool on level 57 were spectacular. Whilst our check in process was very slow (took almost 50 minutes), the staff were apologetic and recovered somewhat by sending cake to both of our rooms as a gesture. We dined at Spago Pool side on the Friday, where we shared a few starter dishes, and then dined at Lavo on the Saturday  - WOW!The hotel rooms are beautiful, and the bathroom was amazing, double basin, shower and bath. Very spacious room with amazing views overlooking the gardens.The staff were very responsive, the Covid Protocols were excellent, and the cleanliness was top drawer.During our stay it was the reopening of the Marquee nightclub, and all tickets were sold out. Whilst having a pre-dinner drink at Rise Restaurant, we shared this with Daniel Whitelaw, the GM of Rise. Long story short, Daniel arranged entry for us on opening night through his contacts at Marquee - Exceptional Customer Service - above and beyond. Thank you Daniel, we really appreciated it - and what a great night to be at the re-opening. We really enjoyed our stay, and are pleased we've had the opportunity to stay at this iconic hotel",July 2022,158,4.0

Spectacular hotel and the famous Moe,"It was our first time holidaying in Singapore and I must say at first glance was absolutely beautiful..  once we arrived at our hotel at Marina Bay Sands it was mind blowing..  WOW!! A spectacular hotel, in fact 10/10.. the next day we ventured up to the 57th floor only to walk out and see the most amazing infinity pool I have ever seen in my life,  then to be greeted by the famous lifeguard Moe. His charisma, service and friendliness was so beautiful and welcoming. One of the best customer service I have ever encountered.

On the second day we went to the pool to see the sunrise, we meet Moe, one of the incredible staff of the pool. He is the Ambassador of the infinity pool.

Hospitality was 100%,Me and my partner arrived at the marina bay sands and immediately you were helped out of the car and your luggage was taken from a lovely gentleman. We then went to check in and as we waited in the queue for too long (all of 5 mins) they fast tracked us to another counter and upgraded our room to a higher floor for the inconvenience. We didn‚Äôt even complain but it was a lovely gesture. We then got to our room to find our luggage already there soon after a knock at the door with a lady wishing me happy birthday and handing over some cake which was a lovely touch! The pool was incredible and you get free snacks and drinks whilst you relax. We then went to watch the gardens by the bay light show from our room which we couldn‚Äôt believe we could see it so clearly! Later in the evening we went to the rooftop to see the view in the dark and a gentleman named Moe introduced himself and he offered to take photos for us by the pool. He made space in an area near the edge and went that extra mile to get some incredible photos for our memories. He also gave us some great tips to watch the sunrise so thank you Moe!

Glad we chose MBS,"We visited Singapore 10 years ago and promised our then 12 yr old daughter we would come back and stay at this iconic hotel.  So what could be more fitting than first trip out after Covid and our daughter graduating and about to start work.  It did not disappoint !! Arriving at 1.30am we were quickly checked in and upgraded to a magnificent room than was more than enough for the 3 of us overlooking garden by the bay. We loved having a balcony to have fresh air in the evening. On leaving our room to explore the amazing breakfast we were asked if our room could be cleaned ( at 9am !!!) and this continued throughout our stay . It was terrific to have the room sorted so early . All staff we encountered went out of their way to be approachable and helpful. The pool was just as amazing as we had pictured and we dined and drank all afternoon while watching amazing plane, helicopters and parachutes around us practice for national day. Unfortunately we did get a little baked as the cloud cover was a little deceptive and we stayed longer than planned‚Ä¶..ouch!! We did not want to leave and will definitely be back ‚Ä¶just really special place",June 2022,81,5.0
Famous landmark and pool,"Staying here for 2 weeks. Maybe due to tower 2 closed for renovations, the hotel is near full occupancy. Couldn‚Äôt book a suite and settled for a room with ‚Äúgarden‚Äù view. The garden is the supertree grove so pretty cool. Got a low 12th floor so pretty disappintedThe porter is helpful, the front desk pretty grumpy. The rest of the staff from housekeeping to operators to gym/pool staff are thankfully as pleasant as the porterThe room is ok sized with a generous balcony and 50-60 inch flat screen tv. The bed is disapponting - not king sized nor luxurious. Towels too, are worn and cheap feeling. So no 5 star luxury feels hereBecause the hotel is huge with 3 towers, it is extra exercise walking to the gym and pool. The gym is large and ok. The world famous pool is always crowded as expected, but nice since it‚Äôs 57 stories upFor convenience, the shopping mall is connected and you can literally get and eat anything thereWrote seperate reviews for the hotel restaurants 7/10",June 2022,"26,690",4.0
Rooftop Infinity Pool sets this place from other places with better food and service,Great trip to Singapore as part of a leg to Maldives from UK.

Excellent hotel but shocking breakfast service!,"The hotel is beautiful and the infinity pool is incredible! It‚Äôs a real flaw that you can only access the pool from tower 3 and not the other 2 towers. Staff were excellent throughout except for at breakfast. Breakfast service in the Rise was extremely poor. We had to wait 15-20 minutes in large queues, even when there were empty tables that were simply not being cleaned. In a hotel that prides itself on efficiency, this was very poor. Even getting water at breakfast was bad as the lady ‚Äúserving‚Äù kept running out of glasses and took ages to get new ones. One elderly guest even resorted to bringing a bowl to get water as they needed some to take their medication! Overall the hotel and service was excellent but breakfast service was utterly terrible and needs to be sorted.",May 2022,16,4.0
MBS most memorable stay,"We stayed 5 nights in a harbour view room on level 42. Checkin was quick and we were made to feel welcome. Room was spacious and the views spectacular. Bed and pillows are a little on the hard side. Obviously we stayed here to experience the infinity pool and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Pool and bar staff are amazing. Special shout out to Maurice, Mary & Ryan. Location is also close to so many attractions and food options. Only small criticism we have is the breakfast in Spago. The manger should take a trip to W @ Sentosa to see how a breakfast should be done. Having said that it didn‚Äôt affect our stay and we loved every minute of our time here and will be back for sure. Everyone at the hotel went above and beyond to make sure our stay was memorable and it made for one of the best holidays we have ever had.",April 2022,46,5.0
Just have to do it once- top of the line!,"One of the reasons we did a stop over in Singapore was to stay at this hotel. Yes, its almost $500 a night. They were very outgoing- allowed us to check in early at 930am- which is virtually unheard of anywhere. They also upgraded us to a king bed high floor with views of the gardens. Staff are outstanding. Facility is beautiful- beyond words. Infinity pool awesome- no longer any limits on time you can spend at the pool. Food super pricey as expected. 3 mini sliders and 2 drinks at the pool for $70 USD. Highly recommend 1 night stay for the experience. Free water and soft drinks in the room fridge is a nice touch.",May 2022,193,5.0
Excellent Dinning Experience & Divine Delicacies at Blue Pearl Restaurant @ MBS,"If you are looking for an enchanting and memorable dinning experience, dinning at Blue Pearl Restaurant located at Marina Bay Sands (2nd level inside the Casino) will definitely not disappoint you.On 25 May 2022 at about 7.15pm, I and one of my food buddies were warmly welcome by Marcus Choong,¬† the AGM of Blue Pearl Restaurant and he then led us to our dinning table which is at a secluded corner of the said restaurant. This is our 4th or 5th visit to Blue Pearl, and we cannot stop returning because of the delicacies created by the Chief Chef, Jason Lau have always been scrumptious and delectable.As there were only two of us, we decided to have a simple meal.¬† We told Marcus we wanted a fish, a lobster noodle and a dessert to complete our meal.¬† Marcus simled and told us that Jason, the Chief Chef was around and the latter would handle our request personally.The first dish that Jason presented us was the 'Fried Garoupa with Asparagus'. The garoupa was super tender and fresh, and the asparagus did na good job in complementing the said dish.¬† The bones of the garoupa were deep fried and became another added delicious dish.The presentation of the 'Lobster Noodle' was both creative and astonishing. The crispy fried noodle was delightful and the main star of this dish (lobster) was utterly enchanting with its freshness, firm and bouncy flesh. I am not a fan for lobster as I always find the lobster either overcooked or not easy to eat.¬† Nonetheless, this lobster was so far the best lobster that I have tasted.'Bird's Nest in Papaya' was the dessert that Jason presented to us¬† The papaya was double-boil and cut into half before it was filled up with bird's nest and milk.¬† It was served hot and left us speechless and wanting for more.We managed to take photos of all the 3 dishes and hope to share with foodies who will be able to appreciate good food and fine dinning experience.All this wonderful experience will not be possible without Marcus Choong and this team of professional serving staff, and the super creative Chief Chef, Jason Lau of Blue Pearl Resturant.Yours Sincerely,Danny Lim",May 2022,3,5.0

"Great view, but train station feeling","Stayed in many 5 Star Hotels in Singapore over the years. The MBS has clearly a great view! Impressive!Yet, the lobby is like a train station, busy noisy, friendly yet very nusy staff. Breakfast isn't recommended, but Chinese lunch was ok to good.The pool and view terrace on top of the iconic building is a bit over regulated. Certain areas couldn't be accessed for picturing (alneit bekng empty) and it was entirely clear why the staff follows such procedures.Rooms are good but a bit dated.

"Fantastic hotel, location and class","This place did not disappoint. From checkin to customer service, hospitality and ambience. It matched all expectations and beyond. I arrived at check in and was ushered to the VIP check in as there was a large party being checked in together. This was great initiative by staff concerned. The rooms were magnificent with all amenities, complimentary toiletries and even the mini bar was free. Lots of information and movies, programmes on the tv. The harbour view room I had was immaculate and the view outstanding. It overlooked the Bay of Gardens and was beautiful and colourful at night. The infinity pool was amazing and the complimentary juices and ice creams were an added treat. Amazing view from the sky deck and even watching the water/light show every evening from 8pm was spectacular. An array of cafes and restaurants and the Bayfront MRT all in close proximity. The gym had everything including a steam room, mini pool and sauna. Great view from the treadmills too. All I can say is that you must stay here to experience all it has to offer. It was worth it. Would recommend Marina Bay Sands and would more likely spend more time , next time . So clean and just an amazing ambience about the place. I must make mention of my clean room daily was due to staff member , Wen Bin. He took pride in his work and endured our stay was pleasant.",June 2022,"1,165",5.0
Recommend but wouldn‚Äôt rush back,"Arrived at Marina Bay for the last stint of our Honeymoon. At the time, check in was busy and seemed it couldn‚Äôt handle the capacity, despite arriving for our allocators time, we waited around 60-90mins to be checked in being passed from desk to desk which happens to be a walk between tower 1 and 3.After getting checked in we got to our room and settled in. The rooms are amazing and the view incredible (city view) with great facilities and add ons with the complimentary mini bar, bottled water, snacks, etc. However we were put in a room next to a another under construction with continuous drilling/hammering starting at 9am and continuing way past 7pm. Although we didn‚Äôt plan to spend too much time in the room, it is still not something we paid the premium rate to listen too. Staff were quite good in getting us moved but again we had to pack up and wheel our suitcases again to another tower to settle back in. Once out, the shops, restaurants and entertainment are amazing. From well known chefs to pub grub styles the selection and quality of food is incredible and the shops the same. There is a water show every evening I think one at 8pm and one at 9pm which is worth a watch! Overall it is a great hotel with so much to see and do around the area but we just felt a bit let down and wondering whether it was worth the hype and money paid. Don‚Äôt forget to screenshot your check in time and register for infinity pool access on the days you want! Deposit of 400 Singapore Dollars was also a bit of a surprise as they take the full room rate with this as an addition.",June 2022,2,4.0
Absolutely AMAZING!!!!,I arrived around 1am after a very long day of travel. Check in was a breeze and I was so relieved when I got to my room. It was super clean and really comfortable.

THE HYPE IS REAL,"My partner and i stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights during June 2022. We stayed in Deluxe Room with a sky view located on the 45th floor. Our room was generous in size,  was equipped with all of the facilities you require and the view was absolutely amazing, in my opinion well worth the extra money when compared to a lower floor view. The hotel's infinitely pool provides breathtaking entertainment to everybody, regardless of their age. The hotel is connected to a shopping centre that offers a casino, high end shopping and an endless amount of food options. Marina Bay Sands is highly recommended!",June 2022,49,5.0

First Time Visit: Exceptional,"It was my first trip to Singapore, and a perfect opportunity to experience the iconic Marina Bay Sands. We got down to the business of gastronomy and locked in a few reservations at Wakuda, a relatively new addition offering contemporary Japanese cuisine by Tetsuya Wakuda, Daniel Boulud‚Äôs ‚Äòdb Bistro‚Äô offers great variety, although we opted for comfort food; burgers and the steak tartare are firm favourites.  Spago by Wolfgang Puck offers refinement, a rich menu with excellent choices and a wine list so impressive; that we struggled to choose. The knowledgeable sommelier really added value to our experience.  Each one is distinctive, not only for its cuisine but the ambience and experience offered. CUT by Wolfgang Puck, was booked out, but we took up a seat at the bar, chatting with a talented bartender who has been with Marina Bay Sands for more than a decade. All in all ‚Äì this resort is undeniably opulent but it‚Äôs the genuine professionalism, warmth and care of the entire team, within the hotel and the wider mall restaurant offering that made this such a memorable first for me. Before departure, a swim in the world's largest rooftop infinity pool was on my checklist, and the beautiful views and dramatic weather made it even more dramatic. Definitely recommend heading up before 8 am if you want the pool almost all to yourself.  Ryan, one of the lifeguards on duty, loves what he does and is a keen photographer too. With a new fourth tower of Marina Bay Sands underway, there is good reason to return. Thank you for an incredible experience‚Ä¶",June 2022,10,5.0

Hopeless service and system,Very bad experience there at MBS and never hope this kind of reception after paying lots..Nobody's on gate open at any towerYou have to open gate yourself and get disinfected soon as you enter because all normal and genral public can roam and enjoy all facilities there roam around and all rather only then infinity pool.Lots of crowd at lobby but no sitting there you have to wait by standing in long cues and family have to suffer.Room showing balcony but don't haveClub not for inhouse guest have not entitled because already blocked by outsiders.nobody have inform us that you have to book advance SKYBAR .Please let me know why I pay a lots just for ambiance that i not entitled to useAll amenities are common for public as well as hotel guest nothing special rather to making all fool.They have preferred for public more rather then guests.I celebrate anniversary at Clark quay beacuse of bad behaviour by club entry they make us wait till 11 then deniesLong long waiting for room dinning and service calls.Some time you have to call up more then three four time which take you 10 to 15 mins for single service Just u taking money only for infinity pool nothing elseIt's a wastage of money and my day a very bad ever experienced i have with you.Thanks for making our anniversary special by this kind of pathenic services,June 2022,68,1.0
