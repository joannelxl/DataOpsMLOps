Wow - just WOW,"OMG.  What a hotel.  When you get past the ""am i good enough to be here"", you simply enjoy the experience - the 57th floor infinity pool, the first class service, the views.  Loved the experience from start to finish.  It isnt cheap - the drinks are not cheap, the food isnt either but push the boat out and you wont be disappointed.  Only criticism was the restaurants are booked weeks before so you need to plan this into your trip and not wait until the last minute.",July 2023,9,5.0
A Unique Hotel Which Needs Further Improvement,"We had booked a Delux Twin Room with a rollaway bed for our teen. We waited for about  45 mins to get checked in. The front desk attendant told me they are going to upgrade us to a Delux Suite on high floors which was a pleasant surprise. At first she said the suite was smoking and when I said No Way she gave us a beautiful suite on 36 floor of tower one with 2 queens beds. The suite is beautiful and fully updated with high end decor, furniture and amenities but with only ONE BIG PROBLEM! There is constant drilling, hammering and construction noise from morning to night and last night it extended to 9PM! We were never told about the low floors of the Delux rooms which we found out latter to be floor 2-11. Additionally we were not told about the construction noise when I accepted the upgrade. The reason for 3 stars is that MBS must fully disclose on its website and partners websites such as Expedia the floor where the room is located and the description of the view as well issues such as construction noise. While the staff are courteous, and responsive and the hotel is great in terms of its architecture, guest experience needs significant improvement in the above areas.",July 2023,84,3.0

Amazing Experience!,"Best customer service and care that a guest could possibly think of, i am a traveller and can claim that this is by far the best experience my family & I had! Although the check in was an extremely long wait, but the staff made up for it. From the first welcome as we were checked in by a lovely lady named Rose, she was so warm and accommodating to our needs and even managed to give us an upgrade! We wanted to thank her again on our check out day but did not manage to find her. As it‚Äôs our first time here in Singapore, we approached the concierge and was also extremely well taken care of by a young lady named Elena, who was extremely bubbly and patient with the buzzing questions we had. What a lovely coincidence that she and our youngest bears the same name, and we were even more surprised to find out she was only 20 years old! All in all from the start till the lovely token leaving the hotel, all employees were helpful and cheerful which was very comforting and welcoming, and we truly enjoyed our 3 day stay here. My family and i would like to truly thank Rose and Elena for making our stay livelier, and we hope to be served by them with their top tier service the next time we‚Äôre back. Best customer service if that‚Äôs what you look for in a hotel.",July 2023,2,5.0
Amazing Hotel,"Hotel is huge and runs like a well oiled machine. Services, staff and facilities all excellent. The view and experience of the rooftop pool doesn‚Äôt disappoint and is a must see for anyone visiting Singapore",August 2022,7,5.0
Would not recommend,"We arrived and tried to check in with two room reservations, there was a long line at the check in counter, we were there around 3:30 and had to wait one hour to get key cards for one of the rooms and by 6pm our other room was still not ready.  I understand it was a 5 day weekend with holiday celebrations but never had I had to wait to get into a room after the typical check in time at any hotel.  Also, the room we were able to get was on the 5th floor, pretty much the lowest floor level and it was super noisy (sounded like construction).  It was labeled as deluxe suite but pretty small and the couch was just a one seater.  Now sure how 3 people would even fit into the room.  We had a party of 6.  Also, the atmosphere was noisy, with kids crying and couldn‚Äôt not find a quiet place to get some work done.  My husband was looking forward to take a shower and go to a meeting but missed it due to waiting around for a room. Luckily, we complained and the hotel was able to let me cancel my two room reservations.",July 2023,2,1.0
Excellent experience. Highly recommended,"We stayed overnight at Marina Bay Sands for my son's birthday. A huge thank you to DP, Paul and Saw for the special experience! We went to the concierge as we were checking out to leave you all a little something but I was advised to write about your excellent service online instead. Excellent staff, great ambience, amazing room! Definitely worth the price for a special occasion splurge. You don't even have to leave the hotel as there are lots to do: lounge by the pool, have a warm relaxing bath, take in the sights at the observation deck, and loads more.I especially like the digital checkin and checkout option. What a hassle free experience.Again huge thanks to DP, Paul and Saw. Keep up the excellent work!",June 2023,36,5.0
"Deluxe Twin Room-Not stated as being LOW FLOOR ,located from level two to level 11","I booked Duxe Twin Room via online reservation- on day of check in , I was told that all the high floor non smoking rooms are fully booked. They are only left with low floors and they offered to place me in  a premium second floor room with zero view, only coconut trees from the balcony. When I filed complaint subsequently, I was astonished to find out that Deluxe Twin Room refers to levels 2 to 11, and not the typical high floor room. This fact is not indicated in the website or hotel confirmation, I have since filed another complaint to MBS hotel and still pending their wishy washy response. Honestly , the service staff standards have declined tremendously, they have poorer follow up skills unlike pre covid days , their call centres are also manned by staffs who articulate poor command of English.",June 2023,2,1.0
Amazing Experience,"This is an expensive hotel BUT you get what you pay for .From the moment we stepped out of the taxi this exceptional service began.On booking we were asked if we were celebrating anything so I am unsure if this is why we got a room on floor 31. Never seen anything like it huge room!We were made to feel important guests and it continued everywhere around the hotel including restaurants and pool area. They achieved their goal of creating an unforgettable memory for us by setting standards of service excellence that are unparalleled by any other place we have stayed.Our whole experience at Marina Bay Sands had made an impressive mark on us and we will be back,",July 2023,5,5.0
"Wonderful Luxurious Hotel, From Deluxe to Luxe","We had multiple stays at Marina Bay Sands over the course of two weeks because we simply enjoyed the hospitality and facilities of the hotel. We actually decided to stay in different types of rooms so we could get the full MBS experience.We started with the standard Deluxe Room which was great. The was cozy, the bed was comfy and the view of the Gardens by the Bay was amazing.Next, we decided to stay in one of the new Sands Premier Rooms which is part of their new Luxe collection. Immediately, we could already tell the room is more spacious and luxurious. We loved the pantry as well as the lovely bathroom.Finally, we stayed at the Sands Premier Suite. This was definitely our favourite room. We felt that this suite was much better than the traditional suites in MBS because the furniture and fixtures are modern, luxurious and comfortable. Just like the Sands Premier Room, we thoroughly enjoyed the pantry, the view and the bathroom!We will definitely be coming back to MBS very soon for another stay since MBS has a very special place in our hearts (we got engaged there!). But more than that, the services, the staff and the facilities make all the difference in making our stays wonderful and memorable.Thank you so much and see you again soon!",May 2023,3,5.0
An iconic landmark and a 5-star experience,"One of the very few hotel stays in my life where I can hardly find anything to criticize. The stay was a surprise for my family, and the staff cooperated with me keeping it a secret up until the last moment. The lady who did the check-in was super helpful, went out of her way to answer all my questions and fulfill my requests, I'm really grateful. The room was beautiful, super clean, the bathroom stylish, with great showerhead and a soap holder in the shower. Comfy bed, good pillows, automated curtains, discreet aircon, quiet. The view was to die for - I chose the ""garden view"" and I still shik it's the (slightly) better option since the city view is available from the pool, the Gardens by the bay is a more unique landmark that the bunch of skyscrapers, plus this room comes with a balcony. The pool and the 3 hotel towers are absolutely iconic, one of the most famous landmarks of Singapore. This is not just a high-end hotel but one of the most famous hotels in the entire world, one that deserves a stay from everybody. A flawless experience.It is really hard to find anything to criticize. Maybe the breakfast was only a 9/10, since it could use some more variety, and one item from the buffet was out of stock by the time we arrived. (Information about breakfast items: eggs, sausages, bacon, potatoes, curries, oriental noodle soups, fresh fruit, sweet pastries, cheese, yoghurt, salad in the buffet; can order more elaborate egg dishes, additional oriental noodles, dim sum from an a la carte menu.)",May 2023,34,5.0
Another great stay at the iconic MBS,"This was our second short stay at MBS and in many ways it has improved over the last few years. Check-in was very busy so we checked in early for the two rooms we had booked thanks to Jemeh and Han's excellent customer service, we were grateful to get one of the rooms 90 minutes early, this enabled us to head up and store our bags while we went down to the huge and extensive food court. When we opened the door we soon realised we had been upgraded to the beautiful Sands Premiere room that had been recently refurbished and was still very crisp and fresh. The attention to detail was mind blowing, lovely coffee cups, glasses etc, even the coffee machine was clad in tan leather!. The level of toiletries was excellent, all fine quality, no skimping here. The room size was large and we had a lovley view over the Gardens by the bay. The huge Super King size bed was so comfortable with huge soft pillows. Got to love those Japanese Toto loos, the lid opened and mood (bowl) lighting came on as you entered the separate room. We stayed in tower one so had immediate access to the pool on level 57 by lighting fast lifts. It must have been a quiet time as the pool wasn't busy at all and was lovely soaking and gazing down at the CBD. Check out was fairly prompt at the hands of KC who was super friendly and efficient. I recommend to all our friends to treat themselves at MBS if they're able when traveling to Singapore,  yes you are just a number in a huge almost impersonal hotel, but in terms of wow factor, she never fails to impress.",May 2023,313,5.0
Sadly underwhelmed,It is without doubt a stunning hotel but with such high expectations it fell short. We upgraded to the high life  and sands club for additional benefits. One was VIP check in as that area was busy we went to the main check in. After a day long journey a cold drink and a more personal welcome would have been good. First room for 3 adults king-size bed and a camped taped up with black masking tape. Complained second room 2 king-size but lost the balcony. Breakfasts club 55 the best Spago the worst but nothing special. Infinity pool please have an adults only area none of the kids use the kids pool so was like a kids water park. Afternoon  tea and drinks with canapies great idea but should be enjoyed in all areas not just Renku Lobby bar and so disappointing that there were never hot vegetarian options. More personal service is needed. It caters more for tourists than hotel guests sorry,May 2023,728,3.0
Life time experience,"I had amazing experience as It was special ocasi√≥n for me, my honeymoon. The room was just perfect.Wonderful pool view everything, I want also specially mention Moe what a amazing person and lifeguard had great time and conversation with him.",May 2023,2,5.0
Incredible hotel,"When planning our honeymoon we knew we HAD to stay here!  Me and my husband have wanted to stay at this hotel for such a long time and it really did not disappoint! The staff were amazing! The room was amazing, the view from the room and the roof was amazing!  The pool was incredible!We feel extremely lucky and fortunate to have stayed here on our once in a lifetime trip!  We wish we could come back and would do anything to come back here again! If you get the chance, stay here, you will not be disappointed.",September 2022,35,5.0
Memorable Experience,Been here for the first time with my Family and Friends..And i must say that everything is perfect‚ù§Ô∏è..Only that when we about to go swimming we cant enter coz it's look like going to rain and there's a sign of lightning after everything is fine they let us in and thats it my kids enjoyed the pool to the point that they dun want to go back to our roomüòÄ..Highly Recommended!!,April 2023,13,5.0
Large conference hotel,"I stayed at Marina Bay in 2018 and was excited to come back.  Like last time, I requested a room overlooking Gardens by the Bay on a higher floor.  I was somewhat disappointed that I could not stay for the full length of my trip, so I stayed at JW Marriott for the first part.  I liked Marina Bay  (MBS) but found that the hotel was extremely large, chaotic and although the views were still stunning, my experience at JW was better.  Beds/linens/pillows were more comfortable (beds are extremely hard at MBS).  I also found the room decor teetering on tired.",May 2023,423,4.0
Spectacular hotel convenient to downtown Singapore,We had a wonderful time at this amazing property. The location is perfect and within walking distance to many popular attractions in Singapore. In addition the rooftop pool is spectacular! I will gladly stay here again.,April 2023,129,5.0
Ever memorable moment,"WOW‚Ä¶.on 20 May 2023  will be an ever-memorable in my life.  We celebrated my 50th birthday and our wedding anniversary in MBS hotel. I booked two deluxe rooms for my family. On the day of checking, they are given an unexpected gift are presidential suit at level 50 instead. It was a wonderful experience for us. We enjoyed it a lot. Thanks to MBS staff for their hospitality and wonderful services. Once again thanks MBS for your outstanding gratitude and make colourful our event.",April 2023,1,5.0
Compelling experience and stay,"As a tourist in Singapore, it's pretty much a given that you have to stay here at least once. We did that, stayed for only 1 night in a city view room. We booked a deluxe room but got upgraded to a sands premier room. The check in was smooth in tower 1, the lobby is humongous, like an airport terminal. We did not get a chance to eat any of the hotel restaurants but there was easy access and paths to the mall. The taxi drop off and pick up was smooth in tower 1.We stayed in tower 2, 21st floor in a renovated sands premier room. It was great, very opulent and grand decor, and of course all clean and new. The room and bathroom were huge, closets are ample, double sinks with tub and shower, and the powder room is a nice touch. City views are amazing but yeah, the afternoon sun hitting the room is killer. The elevator to the infinity pool was out so we had to go back down to lobby to tower 1 elevator. Yes the pool is an experience, and I think mornings are best before the sun / heat get crazy.  We checked out but got keycards to go back up to the pool as we had a late flight. Bottom line, the hotel is expensive, it's a splurge, but it's worth it, and next time we will stay longer.",July 2023,86,5.0
Pure luxury and the highest level of service!,"Although we had a minor issue at check in, the hotel management, namely Victor Mai, took full ownership, kept in touch with us, and resolved the issue way beyond our expectations.This is customer service at the highest level! The hotel is stunning, seriously high end, and there isn‚Äôt anything the MBS team won‚Äôt do for you to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Our family suite was phenomenal and our girls loved the play room/bedroom (Nintendo Switch). The food here is exceptional. We had breakfast at Rise each morning and had a special anniversary meal at Spago on the rooftop, which was outstanding! I think for what you get at this hotel, its truly value for money, the hotel staff truly care about your comfort throughout your stay and let‚Äôs be frank, there are no better views in Singapore than here. Thank you to Victor and the MBS team for making our stay so special and one to remember.We will be back!",February 2024,1,5.0
Wonder staff mark an uneventful stay,"We make the booking before the latest government annoucement which bar all outdoor dinning. And on the day we check in, the casino was shut for deep cleansing too. With gym closed,  the only facilities we get to enjoy was the skypool. They actually hv 3 jacuzzi pools open to use for 15min each too. BRENDON was so nice to put us into the q and alerted us when its available. The house-keeping team was excellant too. It is weird to be doing a staycation when everything is closed. But it is also a time where that extra personal touch make a memorable stay..we will be back again for sure",May 2021,42,5.0
Excellent hotel but shocking breakfast service!,"The hotel is beautiful and the infinity pool is incredible! It‚Äôs a real flaw that you can only access the pool from tower 3 and not the other 2 towers. Staff were excellent throughout except for at breakfast. Breakfast service in the Rise was extremely poor. We had to wait 15-20 minutes in large queues, even when there were empty tables that were simply not being cleaned. In a hotel that prides itself on efficiency, this was very poor. Even getting water at breakfast was bad as the lady ‚Äúserving‚Äù kept running out of glasses and took ages to get new ones. One elderly guest even resorted to bringing a bowl to get water as they needed some to take their medication! Overall the hotel and service was excellent but breakfast service was utterly terrible and needs to be sorted.",May 2022,16,4.0
Definitely place to stay in Singapore.,"The hotel is always very busy, people everywhere and you have to wait in a line for swimming pool and breakfast. But it's a must stay anyway! Amazing view from the swimming pool and actually I believe from all the rooms without paying extra. Amazing breakfast, top quality food! Yum yum yum. I can return just for that. Feel of luxury is present, high quality customer service and friendly staff, very tidy and clean.",November 2019,6,5.0
The most incredible hotel,One of the best hotels in the World that I have stayed in and I have stayed in many luxury hotels due to my job.  From the minute we arrived we were met at the door and escorted to our rooms where check in took place which was seamless and so efficient. The rooms are out of this world and spotless and the attention to detail was fantastic. Breakfast is superb! The staff are incredible from the pool staff to the restaurants staff but the best service we had was we had booked a departure transfer to the airport which was late arriving due to a mix up but was handled very well.  When we arrived at the airport there were 2 staff members from the hotel waiting for us to assist us to the tax refund and check in- I have never had such service in my 45 years in the industry all I can say if you can stay at this hotel it is a once in a lifetime experience.Thank you for making our trip memorable!,February 2024,15,5.0
An incredible experience,"I had visualized the hotel long before I went to it in November 2022 for my 70th birthday, but the actual experience was fantastic. The infinity pool, the restaurants, the shops, the room and amenities were brilliant, but what made it unique was the personalized service. I had informed the hotel I was coming with friends and the management did everything to make the event very special, from being greeted at the airport and then in the lobby, to checking in being done in the room and the champagne and cakes waiting for me. An incredible experience for eight days. I could not have asked for anything better. Thank you Marina Bay Sands.",November 2022,1,5.0
Very terrible experience,"4 hours for hotel to arrange a room despite check-in @3.45pm, followed by 2 different versions of why the lengthy wait occured. Worst is the service recovery that we didnt request for by a person called Jeevan. We dont usually go to such lengths to post. But his story of an IT outage causing Phone service to jam was absurd.",September 2022,16,1.0
Moe the ICON of MBS ü§©,I travelled with my best friend to Singapore in July for a week and we decided to spoil ourselves and stay at the beautiful Marina Bay Sands hotel. On the 57th floor was the ICONIC infinity pool that had the most amazing views. During our stay we met the very entertaining lifeguard Moe. He honestly made our stay so much fun. Moe was there every day to greet us with a smile and fluff our sun bed pillows üòÇ We would joke and livestream so all our family and friends would join in the fun and Moe became the face of our social media lives and so he got the name ICON MOE of MBS ü§©If you are looking for a great time away with 10 ‚≠êÔ∏è service Moe will give you a fun holiday to remember.

Best view in SG,"Had a great experience. Wonderful location. The view from the rooftop infinity pool is like nothing else.

80%,"On the plus side, the hotel offers breathtaking views of the city skyline and convenient access to many of Singapore's main tourist destinations. The space is a tad dated, though.

Out of this world!,"We visited for two nights/three days end July 2023 and were lucky enough to be there for Singapore day rehearsals which saw jets & fighter plane displays, a flag fly by and evening fireworks it elevated the experience of the pool to super heights! We were awake early for sunrise (6-45am) on the pool deck and it was spectacular, you practically get the roof to yourselves (granted there are some hardy folk there too) but set your alarm and go up and watch the day break and use the pool and hot tubs alone.  You can go back to bed if you wish!We visited on our home leg from Oz back to UK with two teens and two adults so we needed two rooms.  Yes it was expensive (¬£2,700GBP) for Friday - Sunday inc breakfast (had a late checkout on one room for the Sunday due to late flight) but it 100% worth spending just to be in that pool! Even if you only book one night, do it! We managed to get interconnected rooms so that was good for our needs.  Rooms have complimentary use of minibar refilled daily (soft drinks/water/crisps/snacks) that was nice.  they provided a birthday cake for my daughters birthday too (3 infact lol) def made her feel special! Rooms are fantastic as should be expected we chose to look over the gardens view but either that or city view are fabulous all lit up at night. (but you see the city view from pool) Garden View from Hot Tubs.  The pool bar does food/snacks and drink and to be honest weren‚Äôt ridiculously overpriced- expensive but okay for where you are.  HUGE hotel complex with the Shoppes and outside it‚Äôs truly huge.  Rise Breakfast buffet was fabulous and plentiful but BE EARLY by 9/9.30am they were queuing 40 deep.  Get there early no queues.  It‚Äôs actually in the foyer which is weird, but feels okay when seated.  they have everything from American, European and Asian breakfast option pretty much everything any culture would need (and some)!We stayed at Tower 3 my only gripe was we checked in 1.30am on Friday and by 2.30am our cases hadn‚Äôt arrived so I had to phone down from room but within 15mins they were there and very apologetic.  But being that hour and after a long flight from Australia we just wanted to sleep.Singapore its self if hot/humid (July) but fabulous, such a green city.  Recommend the Gardens by the Bay - we loved Floral Fantasy the best as SO pretty but all the Cloud Forest/flower dome etc are air conditioned so a god send from the heat. Hoponhopoff Bus goes from outside hotel so that was good.  We did Red & Yellow line full loop before getting off and exploring stops then.Def will come back to Singapore and would probably stay here again!",July 2023,179,5.0
"Amazing rooms, with best views of the SG Marina area stop the infinity pool","The best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed at!

Top quality,"This hotel is on another level! Room equips with all toiletries complementary water tea coffee and snacks. Bath robes and slippers also available.We headed to the infinity pool adorning the bath robes and slippers the views are just breathtaking and service second to none.We visited blossoms restaurant while to food was amazing the staff got on my nerves as soon as you lift the fork to your mouth for the last bite they whip your plate away, they also provide a wet wipe and nuts to your table and charge them to your bill whether you wanted them or not !Singapore is very expensive in general but visit the hawkers for reasonable priced good food",June 2023,19,5.0

Terrible,Nice hotel and great location. But when you have families staying at an overpriced hotel and to wash the kids clothes cost me over 500 dollars and there is no self laundry option‚Ä¶ I would give it a zero.

Second time staying - wont ever stay again.,"This was my second time staying at Marina Bay Sands. The first time I came home raving about it. I now would not recommend it to my worst enemy.The building is of course impressive, especially from the outside. But at more than AUD $1000/night for a basic room, the interior standards need to be much higher.I have given 2 stars for each of the limo drivers we encountered. They were fantastic and so helpful. I would also like to note that I did contact Marina Bay twice over the past 2 weeks to discuss our experience with them before posting this review but they did not bother to respond.The room was, on first glance, neat and tidy. Underwhelming but ok I guess. You can see photos on the website for what it resembles (loosely however, you need to take new photos). However, once you look closely you could see how filthy it was. I took a few photos as examples.There was mould growing in the bathroom (see photo 1).  There were brown spray like marks up the walls near the toilet, which you are left to imagine what they are (photo 2). The ceiling in the bedroom never airs out so is permanently damp (see photo 3) and upon opening a drawer to try and find some champagne glasses (the drawer hadnt even been stocked with glasses) there was a sticky mess (see photo 4).The view from the pool is always impressive however on this stay, it looked dated and dirty. The lounges were faded and sun damaged and the 'wow-factor' of the place has worn off. The ceiling dampness was a concern. We tried to air it out be letting in some fresh air but as soon as you open the door to the balcony the air conditioner shuts off and the room gets very warm. We were travelling with a baby (which makes the condition and cleanliness of this place even worse) and had to keep her cool so couldnt keep trying to fix their air quality problem.It looks to me as if maintenance has gone out the door. I have stayed in 3 star hotels in Vietnam for $60/night that were nicer and better maintained than this.Location is great for convenience as there is a shopping centre underneath with all the overpriced designers in it. No where to sit in there though unless you are dining so be wary if you have people with you who are elderly, disabled or carrying small children. There is no place to rest for 2 minutes. All up, very disappointing. We are not made of money. This was a treat for our honeymoon/husbands birthday and I felt let down. Especially after having a great stay previously. I would usually advise to stay a night or two just for the pool but wouldnt bother with that now. I love Singapore and look forward to returning again however I will not be bothering with Marina bay. It is a tourist trap.",May 2023,2,2.0
Excellent service and thoughtful mbs team.,"I get free birthday room. Easy made reservation,  and check in, no questions being asked.the room is very nice and bigger than expected. Expecially the decorations,  and champagne &cake,  really enjoyed the night there.Daniel and 2 staff ladies accompanied me to the room, saying birthday songs for me.Excellent service team and thoughtful idea. Thank you all.",June 2023,1,5.0
Best service experience!!,"Me and husband were celebrating our honeymoon and on our way home from Bali we stopped in Singapore. I had been to Singapore before and dreamed to stay at the sands one day. This time I was able to afford to stay and was not disappointed. When we arrived at check-in we had a little issue with the site we had booked the stay through but the front desk was so accommodating working with us, they really made us feel welcomed and valued. After we got to the room which had amazing views. At night you could watch the light show from your room. We booked a time to go to the pool. And the pool was beyond beautiful!! We ordered food and with all the people there I was amazed how fast and attentive the staff was to our needs. Later that night we ended up ordering room service because the restaurant didn‚Äôt have any openings but the menu and food was amazing. The menu had so many different kinds of foods! It was the best room service I had ever had! In the morning we then did the breakfast buffet up top where the pool is located. Amazing food again and service. Me and husband love to travel and usually don‚Äôt book more expensive hotels but I definitely thought it was worth the money and will for sure be back. The service was immaculate, even though there were tons of guests I felt there was always a staff member there providing one on one attention.",October 2022,32,5.0

Good Experience,"The Hotel itself it‚Äôs Amazing We Arrived at 3 for Check in and we have to queue for a long time to get our room cause it was so busy.there are 4 of us and we booked 2 rooms. we stayed at tower 3 of marina bay sands. The front desk specially Jewel she‚Äôs very kind and the concierge staff were very friendly and helpful.Our room is spacious, and clean. Loved the balcony it had amazing view.The Infinity pool had great view, too bad that when we went to Singapore the weather was gloomy so we missed the sunset view.The hotel itself was very big, and they directly connected to the shoppes (big mall where everything exists, including casino)",June 2023,7,5.0

Exquisite experience in Singapore,"I am madly in love with the place. It was our first family trip to Singapore. Everything is unbelievable, every step feels like an adventure and our kids were in awe. 6 days in Singapore is too short and we should have stayed longer most specially in Marina Bay Sands. It was our dream to go up on top of that building and we finally made it. I would like to thank the check in staff who gave us a complimentary upgrade to the newly renovated room as it looks so upscale though i was not sure how does the non renovated room looks like. I remember her name is RJ, she was very pleasant and efficient. The waiting time  in line was very long and tiring but it was all worth it upon our turn to checked in. She welcomed us with a very warm smile and enthusiasm and everything has switched into a positive vibe.  The lollipops for the kids is a plus and the kids books too which makes the kids at ease while waiting for our turn. I didn‚Äôt expected to get our room ready as the check in time is 3pm but RJ was too fast and efficient and made sure that we can get a room as she knew that we were travelling with kids. It was a plus for the upgrade and we really wished that we can stay longer. The pool is amazing and the view of the gardens. We have tried the buffet and everyone enjoyed it so much, they have too many options for the buffet. The hotel is too crowded and people are everywhere. It was a good vibe though not the usual hotel that you can imagine. We will definitely come back. Thank you for the great experience.",June 2023,2,5.0
Premium holiday!,Husband and myself stayed for 1 week to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary. The moment we stepped out of SVU from the airport we were welcomed by Yasmina who made check in and our check out easy! Not having to line up at the counter after a long flight. Premium service gave that extra personal touch. If we needed anything or need bookings Yasmina was able to assist. Even decorated our room since it was our anniversary. The room was magnificent as it was newly renovated and the view was what you paid for.  Staff were always professional but friendly. I recommend Sands premium booking at Marina Bay Sands as you won‚Äôt be disappointed! Thank you Premium Services MBS!We will see you again!,June 2023,1,5.0
Marina Bay & Joanne- Exquisite above the rest!,"Thank you Marina Bay Sands for giving my family THE BEST vacation! The place is spectacular, everyone is so hospitable and the feel of the hotel is amazing with so much to do, a plethora of food options to indulge in, shopping and the one of a kind rooftop infinity pool! The immense amenities will blow any other hotel away! I must give my highest praise and thank you to Joanne-assistant mgr of premium services. She provided the most amazing hospitality like no other hotel we stayed before! We stayed 4 days in Marina bay then decided to stay in the city but was highly disappointed.  We called Marina bay and although they were fully booked, Joanne worked hard to help find rooms for my family and even offered to pick us up to transport us back over so that we can end our vacation right! She really went above and beyond for my family of 7! This is the epitome of customer service! MBS...she is a GEM!! I will be forever thankful to Joanne for the top notch hospitality, ensuring every detail of our vacation was so wonderful and making sure my kids, parents and family had the best time! She won our hearts and our love for this hotel!   This is the only place to stay in Singapore...everywhere else is incomparable! If you want a memorable vacation...Marina Bay is it!!  Joanne you are THE BEST and really exemplify the exquisite premium service that puts Marina bay sands above the rest! We will never forget you and your team.

Birthday Surprise,We went to one of the restaurant for my daughter‚Äôs birthday and we had a wonderful experience as the staff did an amazing surprise for my daughter by arranging a beautiful chocolate cake as well as singing the birthday song by almost the entire crew beautifully with mesmerising rhythm as I only informed the manager to get us a best seat since it‚Äôs a special occasion to be remembered and my daughter was taken off the ground as she didn‚Äôt expected anything like that and we will cherish those moments forever.,November 2022,1,5.0
Inconsistent staff and rude guests,Had a great stay here. Got upgraded to a higher room for my birthday and chocolate cake in room. SkyPark has great views but is ruined by the guests - some are incredibly rude to the staff and it‚Äôs just embarrassing/upsetting to be around. We were allowed to use SkyPark for the day after we checked out but the shower facilities are not nice at all and definitely not 5* level. All staff were lovely and accommodating aside from check out where the process is very rushed and impersonal - feels like because you‚Äôve stayed and they have your money they no longer care about your experience. We found Andrea and Patrick at Tower 3 check out particularly rude (there was a man who i didn't get the name of handing out water to guests who was great). overall it is worth coming here for the views and rooms but Skypark is subpar for a 5* hotel.,May 2023,56,4.0
Best Service in MBS,We have been very delighted with the premium service of MBS. Joanne and John have shown us great hospitality and helped us in making our stay very good.

"When at the MBS, ask for Andre, Silver, and Ramon! For weddings, Rachel, Ken, and Raimondo are THE A-TEAM!","Singapore is a world within our world, but the Marina Bay Sands is a special world apart! We booked our wedding at the Convention Center and enjoyed an extended stay at the hotel.  Our only regret was not staying longer to take in all the rich amenities on offer at this amazing property.To us, MBS is a marvel of soaring architecture that has been distilled into an intuitive, uniquely human, and tactile environment.  At every turn, there are thoughtfully-curated vignettes that embrace and delight.  When you layer in the courteous professionalism of EVERY team member we encountered, you are left with the impression of being cocooned in a climate of uncompromising and unapologetically-personalized customer service excellence.  Rachel, Ken, Raimondo and their team members created an EPIC wedding venue in the Begonia Room that was part Singapore, part Hollywood, and pure MBS!  The meticulous attention to detail during our long distance planning (from Atlanta, Georgia, USofA) and later onsite execution by the build team was matched by the service and wait staff in every meaningful way.  Every guest walked away with the impression they had experienced a singularly special event.Andre and the Premium Services Team contacted us before arrival, arranged transportation, and were waiting to introduce us to the property and our lovely, pristine, and richly appointed room.  Each and every venue we encountered, from the Infinity Pool to the Banyan Room and several restaurants in-between were feasts for the senses and echoed the epitome of quality and customer service.  Of the way-too-many staff members to name, Silver and Ramon stood out as singular exemplars of the MBS brand.To everyone at MBS, we salute you for doing both the little and the big things right, for being amongst the very best we have encountered in our decades of travel, and for creating a memory for a lifetime and beyond. f&T  :)",May 2023,3,5.0

Incredible honeymoon stay,Stayed here for the first leg of our honeymoon. This hotel really is spectacular and worth every penny. We were very kindly upgraded to a suite on the 53rd floor which was super appreciated. The view was phenomenal and the room was bigger than our house!

Would always now stay at this hotel when visiting Singapore.,April 2022,48,5.0
Hugely disappointing,"The hotel itself is so vast it feels like a shopping centre. Rooms are average, a similar level to the Fullerton and Park Royale, despite the latter two being a fraction of the price. My room was a lower level so I view (and noise) from the road both sides. Room service is crazily overpriced. Incredibly inflexible over later checkouts. Only reason it doesn‚Äôt get 1 star is because of the impressive pool.",March 2023,39,2.0

The most overrated hotel experience?,"Marina Bay Sands is definitely a bucketlist destination but having stayed there once we would never head back.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong the building is impressive, views breathtaking, the room was magnificent and the SkyPool is an amazing engineering feat.  I found the staff hugely attentive and very friendly, but it was the frictions and irritations along the journey that soured the experience.From a slow, we‚Äôd say painful check in, to long queues for well just about everything (pool lounge, breakfast table, etc.) and so overpriced.  We had a spa experience in the Banyan Tree which was nice but not worth the price tag attached.The one standout experience for me was aBirthday Dinner at LAVO.  The food was great, the service excellent, cocktails expertly mixed and a complimentary birthday dessert a very thoughtful touch.It is curious that it looks like a ship atop the towers as the experience really reminded me of being on a budget cruise.  Maybe scheduled breakfast slots, staggered check in and and lower costs of food and drinks might make the experience more enjoyable.Anyway been there done that, but not again at that price!",March 2023,2,3.0

Unforgettable birthday weekend!,"I booked the High Life package as a gift for my husband‚Äôs 30th birthday. Before booking I had a lot of questions which the members of staff at MBS were more than happy to help me with. After an initial conversation, I decided it would be the perfect way to celebrate his birthday. I was given lots of birthday options for how the room could be decorated. This whole process was seamless. A few days before our stay, Mark reached out to me to help with any reservations I wanted to make and to ask if there‚Äôs anything else the team could do to make our stay special.The pick up service was very punctual and our journey to the hotel was super comfortable - a great way to begin our stay! Mark greeted us at the car door and talked us through the hotel, the restaurants, timings and escorted us to our room.The room was incredible! Immaculate - with views of Gardens by the Bay, the Supertrees as well as the city. Mark and his team had left a handwritten birthday message and cake (which was absolutely delicious) for my husband. Needless to say, my husband was very surprised! Mark gave us a tour of the room and then left us to get settled in.During our stay, Mark checked in on us several times to ensure we were having the best experience. He responded to any messages or questions I had within minutes.My husband definitely had the best weekend celebrating. His review for the hotel and the team is below:Thank you everyone at MBS for an incredible birthday weekend. The service provided by Mark and his team was unlike anything we‚Äôve ever experienced elsewhere. We were picked up in a car from our accommodation and taken to the hotel, here we were greeted by Mark and Rosie and welcomed into the hotel. We were taken directly to our room to be shown around. The room itself was amazing, the best hotel room we have ever stayed in and would definitely recommend to anyone. Mark and team were so kind, they set up happy birthday balloons in our bedroom, provided a cake as well as a hand written message wishing me happy birthday and a wonderful weekend. It was truly an unforgettable weekend, the hotel itself is well worth the money and we loved every minute of our weekend there.

MBS is the epitome of a true 5-Star hotel!,"MBS is indeed topnotch all the way! A five-star rating is an under-statement. Their attention to detail and responsiveness to customers are beyond expectation. The Premier suite is worth every penny. The suite is the definition of luxury and elegance. I usually carry my own hair dryer every time I travel. But this time I did not have to use it because MBS Premier Suite has the dyson hair dryer. From the amenities, toiletries, robes, slippers, beddings - everything is topnotch! But what impressed me the most is their excellent customer service. Shoutout to Mark! He was there during our check-in and he was also there to bid us goodbye when we left and made sure that our stay was as comfortable as possible. He booked our transportation; followed up on everything we need. He is a real gem! Thank you Mark and to all the staff at MBS, you guys made our stay most memorable and satisfying.

Amazing time at Marina Bay Sands,We had 3 wonderful nights at MBS it is an amazing iconic hotel. We stayed in the Orchid suite on 53rd floor the views over the gardens by bay out to sea was superb. Our stay  was made even better by the Premium Services Care Executive Mark who was extremely helpful and there in an instant if anything was needed a real asset to the establishment. We also had wonderful waiter Alvin in club 55 hope all goes well with birth of your 2nd child.  In the Spargo bar/resterant  which has the best bar views in world when looking over the infinity pool as darkness falls  on  Singapore skyline. We   where cared for by manageress Ghigie and her wonderful staff especially Riza so bubbly  she was infectious you just had to smilr.

A stay at the orchid suite,"Check-in at vip was fast even though we were early. Offered later checkout and they booked transportation to the airport at the check-in. Got some complementary coffee and coke while waiting (though added on the bill later on). Really nice big room even if its getting old. Wished a high floor and got 54. Amazing city view from the room.  Great service and staff at club 55 that were very friendly when arriving. And free ameneties is always nice with mini-bar included. Cleaning staff didnt know english, so hard to explain, and room service dropped bread on floor and left pieces which when we noticed didnt get cleaned so we had to pick it up from the carpet. Great laundry service. Pool amazing, unfortunately rather bad weather the 4 days we stayed. Its a bit pricey for the orchid suite but love to visit again.

Out expectations were not met - but service top notch. A little style over substance.,"Where to begin... Our sons (now 11 and 8) chose this hotel as their post COVID holiday after watching the BBC Race Across the World programme.  All they wanted was the infinity pool - and that didn't disappoint (although why is is not heated??!).  We went straight off the back of 7 nights at an amazing 5* hotel in Thailand and this was pipped to the the highlight of our stay.  However we left feeling a little disappointed. Pre arrival communication excellent and helped me arrange treats for my husband's birthday. We were apprehensive about the check in process after friends and colleagues stating how long it took, however they took one look at my husband on crutches with a broken leg, and whisked us into the guest lounge, which while took an age to check in (40 mins), we were sat down with coffee and the kids with lollies and drinks, which was very much welcomed. We were in a Deluxe King Sky View as it had a sofa bed for the kids, and the room was HUGE with the most amazing views.  However the room itself was very basic. We likened it to a Premier Inn (UK based will know what that comparison means).  It was a little dated but functional The biggest letdown was the sofa bed.  It was the cheapest, most uncomfortable bed we've come across in all our years of travelling (and we travel a lot).  The mattress was about 5-7cm deep and the kids could feel every spring as they sat on the bed and rolled over. We had to ask for an extra duvet just for them to lie on so they could sleep.  Not acceptable in a 5* hotel.But our biggest issue was the SMELL.  The smell as you walked through reception as divine but our floor, despite being non smoking, stunk like a working mens club from the 1980s.  Each time we opened our door or stepped out of the lift, the smell of smoke hit you and we were on a no smoking floor.  Why hotels in this day and age allow smoking I don't know, but it was vile.  On the plus side, the service was superb.  From the reception staff to the roof top bars, you were always greeted with a smile and a welcome.  Everyone went out of their way to help you.  We didn't have a great experience in the Rise buffet (see separate review) but loved the ability to come out of your room and be in the mall within 5 mins.  A big shout out to the lifeguard on the roof terrace (forgotten his name but used to work on the cruise ships out of Southampton, UK) - he was a delight to talk to and cheered us up each morning we went for a swim.Would we return? No, I think we'd head to the Fullerton or Raffles this time.",February 2023,91,3.0
Definitely the best hotel in Singapore,"Everything went smooth from the time we checked in until we left. Food was amazing. Service is efficient during my stay. Love the view from the infinity pool. The staff are wonderful especially Fir, Ravi & Reggine. They are very helpful, approachable & serve beyond their duties and ensured all the plans are in order. That says a lot about the high quality work that they doing with the team and the hotel. No regrets and definitely will be visiting again.",March 2023,4,5.0
Marina Bay Sands Hotel experience,A person I know stayed here and thought it was great so I had to do the same.The design of the building is fascinating and a great landmark in Singapore for kms around. The top part which looks like a boat is the famous pool with a view to die for and a bar in the middle. I absolutely had to try it out but it was cold in the water and only 21o or so out. Freezing!Even though I paid about $AUD 800 per night the $52 breakfast was extra! So we went elsewhere for it.There is a pedestrian walkway to the MBS Shopping Centre which is handy although the food court is a good 15 min walk.On the ground floor there are shops and restaurants.Would stay here again but not good value for money where the brekky's concerned as I've paid a similar rate at other places and got brekky.,March 2023,8,5.0
Hospitality needs to be improved,"We were staying in Room 4101 from 26.10.22 to 29.10.22 & found service very poor. Water was served in broken glass, food was served without covering. After complaining 3 times, glass was changed after 20-25 mins. No regrets from hotel side. This shows poor hospitality. Hotel is pretty good, luxurious & at prime location. Options for pure vegetarians & indian foods are very less. This needs to be taken care off. Better to stay only 1 night to enjoy INFINITY POOL. Nothing more great about it.",October 2022,8,3.0
Spectacular view and memorable experience,"Be prepared to queue for your check-in.  We waited for about 20-30mins to check into this 5 star hotel.   The hotel lobby area is big and looks like it can be access by lots of walk-in non-hotel guests  as well, there are not enough seats for hotel guests.  Room is big and comfortable.  We came to Marina Bay Sands to enjoy the view from the room. and that we have achieved. The view from the gym, bar and infinity  is spectacular.  Highly  commendable are the hotel staff - very friendly, respectful and helpful.",February 2023,5,4.0
Simply excellent,We stayed on a Sunday night to celebrate my partner's birthday while we were in Singapore and the experience we had was simply breathtaking! Upon checking-in we were greeted by Shataz who took us up to our room and made us feel right at home. Shataz's warm and friendly nature made us feel very comfortable and nothing was too much of an ask. A big slab of chocolate cake and a candle was on the table for my partner for her birthday which was a lovely touch. Showers were made available for us after checkout and before going to the airport which was very convenient. We can not thank Mark and Shataz and the team enough for their excellent hospitality and definitely recommend staying at MBS!,March 2023,1,5.0
Nothing short of perfect,"All we can say is WOW. To the Marina bay sands team, thank you (especially Abdul Rahman) The food we had for lunch at Spago was honestly unbelievable. We come from a country where we are known to have some of the best food, and I can honestly say Spago was up there with one of the best restaurants we‚Äôve ever eaten at in all our travels. The views, the pool, the experience, the convenience and the transport was all 10/10. Don‚Äôt bother to look anywhere else when coming to Singapore, this hotel is iconic for a reason. The rooms were fully equipped with the coolest technological features I‚Äôve ever seen and the whole place is nothing short of luxurious in every way. Thank you MBS, we will defiantly be back. A big big thank you to Abdul Rahman, he is an asset to the team and is a very large reason for the amazing experience we had.",March 2023,3,5.0
Marina Bay Sands,"I have stopped here before and must say it‚Äôs simply spectacular and something I‚Äôll remember fondly. The rooms are spacious, clean and I was lucky enough to have access to the pool as well as club 55 for drinks and nibbles. Absolutely superb!I am due to return in a couple of days and am trying to find out if alcohol is still included in the lounge or not? I messaged concierge but am yet to hear back from them. If anyone knows, I‚Äôd be extremely grateful if they could let me know :-)",March 2023,123,5.0
Beautiful Hotel,Singapore is such a beautiful place to go and the hotel was great. It has very nice view and the facilities was just nice.

Huge hotel complex with a great view,"We stayed here for 4 nights. We had no idea that the restaurants would be so busy and it would be so hard to book once we were here, so book ahead! We ate in both Lavo and Cest la vie and had good meals in both.. the prices are extortionate though for what you are eating. Cest la vie‚Äôs menu is pretty limited too. We had a drink afterward in their sky bar which was really nice with that great view. Breakfast the first day, what a queue! We had to wait half an hour.. one of their restaurants, Rise is being refurbished so one less restaurant for breakfast‚Ä¶ (my advice come early) we skipped it the next day but had had it the last 2 days and the queues were better but we were earlier. Breakfast was ok, nothing special. The staff are all lovely, we didn‚Äôt encounter not one unhelpful or miserable member. The pool - well what can I say about that big pool with that great view, not bad waiter service and comfy loungers.. just lovely. People were out there until late at night relaxing and having food on the loungers. The room was spacious, great showers and plenty of products.. the bed was pretty hard though and sadly the complimentary fridge only had a few cans of sugary fizzy drinks.. we left a note for our housekeeper to swap them for sugar free drinks but no luck.. I tried again for our last day and bingo two coke zeros.. We thought we‚Äôd try the casino one evening and what a palava, passports, your Singapore entry form then their face recognition couldn‚Äôt match me to my passport .. any how we nearly have up as we are not gamblers, we just wanted to have a quick go at roulette. Any how we finally got in.. it was ok‚Ä¶ similar to the Hippodrome in leciester square being leant on and pushed out the way so players could put their bets on.. It has a walk way to get to the Garden by the Bay which was very handy. We could also see the light shows, one from our room and one from the Cest la vie bar. The hotel is massive‚Ä¶ shops, museum, theatre the lot. It‚Äôs spotless and seems really well run. We had a very pleasant 4 night stay.",February 2023,591,4.0
Singapore or sing for more,"The Marina Bay Sands is a beautiful hotel, but the rooms are over priced and disappointing. The roof top infinity pool should be heated, but its not and as many guests ventured in to get that must have photo, the look on their faces was priceless.

Wonderful hotel in Singapore,"Marina Bay Sands is a wonderful and iconic hotel in Singapore, close to the Convention Centre and Shopping Centre with the same name. The room, no. 1107, was large and comfortable, with a double bed and a sofa. As a guest one has free access to the Observation Deck, the SkyPark and infinity pool. The hotel also has several restaurants to choose from.",June 2023,246,5.0
Quality has gone downhill,"I have stayed there a few times. It used to be a really good hotel, but recently quality has gone down a lot. Prices are up from like 400 to 1200 per night and the SGD is stronger so value is obv worse. But many other things have deteriorated with the hotel. Checkin is slow, long lines, moving slowly, taking long time for each customer. Early checkin not available and no notice when the room was ready. New Premium rooms are filled with alcohol mixers and fancy heavy stone pieces leaving little space left, no desk so no workspace, if you want to use a laptop you have to do it on the floor. There is construction going on making my room vibrate and be noisy from 11 to 6pm. Pool is crowded, often you cannot find a single sunbed available. The gym has moved into the shopping centre which is awkward. The lift at Tower 2 doesn't work so lots of people end up going up and down to get to Spago. When you leave the aircon automatically goes to max so you come back to an icy cold room every time and TV is on every time. Room service didn't do any turndown while I was out until 8pm with ""please make up room"" on for 3h. If you stay here you do it because it's a unique hotel, but don't expect to leave as a happy guest. Some good things though. Bed is comfy, cool AC knob, tea and chocolate are great and yeah it's an epic building for sure!",July 2023,4,3.0
Treated like Farm Animals,"Raymond Tan, Guardian of the Toilets on the 56th floor and very rude. I was carrying a fussy baby and trying to calm him along the row of paintings outside the restrooms. Raymond literally screamed at us and engaged aggressively as we approached the end of the hallway. Accused me and the baby of trespassing like common criminals.He then condescendingly ushered us away like pigs and sheep. Such a shame that the icon of Singapore has such poor hospitality. I understand the need to prevent non hotel guests from entering certain areas but staff are trained less in courtesy and more in damage control. No class.",July 2023,1,1.0

Exquisite‚Ä¶. Best Experience Ever,"Words can not express the level of gratitude and utmost enjoyment/customer service that my husband and I received from Marina Bay Sands.  From the moment the transportation picked us up to the premium services that secured checkin of our room, the service was like no other.  The room, the bathroom, the infinity pool, the restaurants - top level service and a top level experience.

Immaculate experience at Marina Bay Sands,"Stayed at MBS over the week and it was beyond words. The pool view and the room view was incredible and we can‚Äôt wait to be back again at the hotel. Check in was quite long and the staff at check in was very impatient, so we were quite disappointed. The staff, who was a young Chinese lady wearing glasses simply rushed the process and made it seem like they can‚Äôt wait for us to leave the desk! We queued for over 10 minutes and we get this treatment at check-in which was unbelievable. But truthfully, besides that particular staff, every other employee was extremely friendly and me and my wife enjoyed the stay so much that we have already booked for another one! Special thanks to Elena from the concierge who was extremely helpful. We followed her recommendation to places which was great and she was so kind in assisting us with taxi. Would like to thank another staff but unfortunately we forgot his name, he kindly assisted us with our luggage and very gently guided us to the queue when we first arrived. We hope to encounter them when we return next month. Truly hope to receive a better check in experience when we return next month.",July 2023,3,5.0
Overall a good experience,"This review is for Gelo from Spago. His service is fantastic. Always eager to help with great energy. Thank you, man! The hotel is good. This was our second time here.

Obnoxious,The architecture is astonishing however the obnoxious staff on more than one occasion make it an awful experience and very shocking. It appears that as the building is so iconic they feel they don't need to provide service. Hop over to Bali to understand and train in excellent customer service,March 2023,2,1.0
Not a bad hotel but not worth the price,"Honestly, I was kind of disappointed. The room was smaller than I expected, interior design feels like Hilton (and Hilton is probably half price).One thing I particularly dislike is that the hair dryer can not be used in bathroom, only at the desk, cause the outlet in the bathroom does not fit (unless you're bringing your own hair dryer)Not a bad hotel but not worth the price",April 2023,"1,090",3.0

Poor reservation service ended costing us $$ and leaving us disappointed.,"We had a confirmed booking for two room interconnecting which we made by email about eight months prior to our stay. At the time of booking they said an email would be sent three days prior to our stay to make a booking for the roof top pool. We never received an email to make a pool booking so I called the hotel. Turns out they had no record of our booking. They then quoted two rooms (not connecting at a much higher rate than we had initially booked). After getting off the phone, I checked their website and a higher category of room was cheaper than what they have quoted. I asked them why this was and never received a response. I then cancelled the rooms they booked for me and rebooked the higher tier rooms which also included breakfast.  When we arrived at the hotel I explained all of the above to the lady who checked us in. I asked why they wouldn't honour the original booking as was quoted. I ended up giving up as the level of compression was limited and when I asked to speak to a manager was told there were none available to talk to. The following day I went to reception to ask for a late check out. In our original booking we had been quoted a half day charge for a 6pm check out. I asked for the same. I was told we could have a late check out but would have to pay the full rate for another day. Confused I asked why and was told they were having a system shut down at 1pm and it was all they could offer. When we arrived they took full payment for the rooms ($2700)plus an extra $100 per room for sundries. When we went to check out my husband not realising I'd already been charged was charged a further $2500. When alerting the receptionist to this we were told the $2700 would be refunded but it could take up to three weeks! The hotel rooms were nice. The pool was a one time experience which I'm glad to say we have ticked that box. Would we stay here again? Hell no!",April 2023,28,3.0
Top of the world,"Oh boy - this is the one to beat . Now the only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 is that I was on level 6 and the view was non existent and have had better views in Skegness for a lot less money. The room was fantastic and everything clean as you‚Äôd expect although I did see a few hairs from the last guest under the loo seat. Having worked as a cleaner I tend to notice things . The rooftop experience was awesome and we seemed to strike lucky with not so many people so had one of the hot tubs to ourselves for ages and no end of choice on loungers.  All the staff were very professional and polite from door men to cleaners ,restaurant staff and reception . The views from the top were awesome as well as the infinity pool . You just have to stay here once in your life .",December 2022,29,4.0

"Our 2nd visit, this place never dissapoints! It is a special place.","What can I say that hasnt already been covered? Marina Bay Sands is simply an incredible destination and is now tradition for my wife and I to spend 1 night of our stay here when we travel to Singapore. Its Iconic and always special when you visit. There is nothing like it in the world.Last time we had a city view, but this time we had a view of Gardens by the Bay with a balcony which i actually prefer, hundreds of ships to the horizon and good for plane watching too as they fly in to Changi airport.The pool and skypark is the main attraction ofcourse, and its always spectacular. Poolside food and drink service with that incredible and unique vantage point never gets old. My last comment is to address the negative comments about price, honestly i have no idea where that comes from, considering there are other top end hotels (Raffles and other big name hotels) that are just as expensive and 2-3x more expensive with rooms that arent as nice as Marina Bay Sands, but simply cannot compete with the experience of the infinity pool and skypark. All things considered I'd say the cost per night is great value for money.We cant wait to come back next time we are in Singapore!",April 2023,77,5.0
Stunning hotel in a beautiful city,"The MBS is simply a stunning hotel. It has an excellent location, with views either towards the magnificent city skyline or the bay and the roof top pool is simply breathtaking. Our room was spacious and immaculate and faced the city skyline. Breakfasts were good but were located at the rooftop restaurant because of renovations, so it was a little hectic. The hotel sits next to the shopping mall complex so there is a wide selection of places to eat. However, there is a coffee shop on the ground floor which is excellent. The nightly light show in the gardens is absolutely stunning.",March 2023,7,5.0
5 stars experience !,"So nice ! We stay in this iconic hotel and we loved !The experience of being in the pool and on the rooftop is spectacular, worth every euro!During our stay there was a heavy rain with thunderstorm and we were evacuated from the swimming pool.

Great stay with great views of the city,Very cool hotel in the heart of Singapore.  We stayed three nights with our family and had a great time.  Especially liked the location near the gardens and all the shopping.  The rooms could be a little bigger and more appointed for the price but ton of dining options.  The pool is incredible but the experience kind of gets ruined by all the instagram/influencer wannabes.  For the love of God put your phone down and enjoy the view!,March 2023,15,4.0
The best stay!,"My partner and I stayed for 1 night at the end of March and we had the best time. We chose to stay here because of the infinity pool but everything was incredible. We were given a room on the 50th floor which had a great view of the city. The room, pool and service were all perfect and we couldn‚Äôt have been happier with our stay.

We very much hope to stay again in the future!",March 2023,5,5.0
Exceptional and Wonderful experience.,"I can‚Äôt begin to explain how happy I am with this place! This is such a great experience where my husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary. The room is so huge and clean. No mess or dirt can be seen. What makes this place more special is when we swim in the infinity pool. Nothing can beat the beautiful sceneries here. I would like to thank the pool team staffs Christy (morning time) Maricon and Reg (evening time) who made us feel so comfortable and safe during our stay in the pool area especially with my 35weeks pregnancy bump.

Amazing hotel & Spectacular views,"Wow! The Marina Bay Sands is an amazing hotel, we were greeted by someone very friendly and chatty at the door who took our luggage and took us inside, I had previously signed up to the marina bay sands rewards scheme so I went to get my card (the desk is opposite check in at tower 1) whilst my partner stood in the queue to check in to our room, there was a bit of a queue but all in all check in went very smoothly and quickly, I had filled in a form via email with some check in details which I think made things go quicker. There was also a man giving out bottles of water while we were in the queue, the staff were lovely and made us feel so welcome. We checked in at Tower 1 (There is also a check in at Tower 3 but it closes at 5pm ) Our room was in Tower 3 floor 45 room 4519, we stayed 3 nights and we had a Deluxe King Harbour View room, which faces the sea and also faces gardens by the bay and the view was spectacular!! You have to see the view to believe it and at night time it‚Äôs even better, our room was also a sunrise view room, we ordered breakfast room service to be delivered at 7.30am and was delivered on time. Breakfast was delivered and set up on a table for us and was so lovely to watch sunrise whilst eating breakfast, we didn‚Äôt eat breakfast at the restaurant as our room was booked without and to add buffet breakfast was $61 or $53 to prebook, I should mention breakfast is till 11am for room service and you have the option to order individual items which is cheaper than the Buffet Breakfast, mind you there are plenty of places to eat breakfast in the centre or at the hawker market which is nearby. Considering how big the hotel is the staff were so lovely and friendly and make you feel so welcome, there is even a place to get an umbrella in case it rains. The Infinity Pool was amazing and mesmerising, let me tell you it‚Äôs definitely worth a stay at this amazing hotel, yes it‚Äôs busy and sometimes you get lost with the excitement but it‚Äôs worth every penny, the building and the views in this hotel are spectacular, the room was comfortable with a shower and everything included, robes slippers coffee tea and coffee machine, bathroom amenities by Roberto Cavali, everything you could need, water was given to us for free also. We had lunch at the pool which also has waiter service and the prices were reasonable.We even ate at Lavo restaurant which was so delicious. Staying at this hotel is an experience you will never forget. I really enjoyed my stay here at the MBS and I will definitely return next time I go to Singapore 100%.

A stunning hotel,"Breathtaking hotel in every sense - the lobby and surrounding attractions are incredible. You need to book a time slot for check-in and even the pool but you can stay all day. I paid extra for a room with a view but strangely the view is partially obscured with an outside horizontal pillar. Worth a stay, even if for only a night.

A dream fulfilled,"I have been wanting to stay at this hotel ever since it opened back in 2012 and am still in awe that I have seen and stayed at this magnificent structure. The hotel staff are extremely nice and friendly. Although it took a considerable amount to check in (my poor 10 year old had motion sickness from the flight was nauseous). Simply exchange money took 5-10 minutes with all of these antiquated forms the staff needed to complete. Upon check-in to the room ......wow! The room was amazing and the views of the city were stunning. The room was much larger than I expected and the staff was nice to add a rollaway bed. The breakfast at Spago was so-so.  At 8am, we already made our way to the pool before the rush. Early morning, there aren't a lot of people. I made it there before my family got ready and got stunning pictures. The staff were so friendly, especially KJ who took plenty of pics of me and said his job is to make us happy. he sure made us happy and memories for life.The water was a bit cold at that hour, but the views were unparalleled and some of the best in the world. We still couldn't believe we were staying at the Marina Bay Sands resort. We cherished every moment. The smiles on all of the workers faces really made us feel good. They went above the call of duty to make us feel good. We only spent two nights here and the following day, our flight was early before breakfast would open. The hotel organized room service for us with so many items that I lost count and didn't charge us extra for it. It's little touches like this that made our experience such a delightful one.I dreamed of this place for over a decade and it lives up the expectations! We made memories for life!",March 2023,177,5.0
Fabulous birthday celebrations,"It has always been a dream to stay at Marina Bay Sands, and for my husbands birthday we stayed in a Garden view room on floor 30. The room is modern, spacious and very clean with the largest TV, I have ever seen in a hotel room. But this room is all about the view.  You can see the Singapore flyer to the left, all the ships out at sea, right around to the cruise ship port. Then right in front of you is the beautiful Gardens by the Bay, which are stunning by day and night.The shops and the restaurants are wonderful. We had the best Italian meal ever at Lavo(Also reviewed) which is on the top of the building. Stunning views of the city and the light show below.Then there is the pool. You have to be staying at the hotel to use the pool and with 2,561 rooms with let‚Äôs say 2 per room,  around 5,000 potential  users, sounds impossible. The pool is 142 meters long, the longest infinity pool in the world. It opens 6am to 11pm.  (no need to book) It has an adults only section and family section. We visited the pool at night 9-11 and during the day 3-5. It never once felt too busy or over crowded, in fact it had a lovely relaxing atmosphere.But it is the people who work at this hotel that make the stay extra special. Everyone is friendly and happy to help make your visit the best experience for you.",March 2023,42,5.0
2nd time around,"My second stay here and only writing another review this time around to call out two things for my fellow travelers.1. If you check-in early, they can store your bags and will offer to call/text/email you when your room is ready. I didn't receive any of those come check-in time so I went to the front desk to inquire. Turns out my room was in fact, ready. So, if they forget, just poke them, or you risk waiting well into the evening.2. One big reason for staying at this hotel is access to that amazing ""selfie"" infinity pool. FYI every single guest that enters the pool area needs a room key. We did not find this out till after taking 3 separate elevators from our room to get to the pool. Sooo back down we went to fetch that other card. Apparently this stipulation is printed in tiny font on the back of your room key card (because everyone always examines their room key in microscopic detail). Front desk person should've mentioned but neglected to so I'm letting y'all know now so you don't have to do the extra trek. Make sure each person in your party gets a key at check-in and brings it with them to the pool (not sure what to do about children...).Other than that, a pleasant stay. Premier rooms are really nice, visiting the gardens is very convenient and tons of really great food/shopping options without ever losing air-con. Remember it's a massive hotel (Vegas-style) so they deal with everything in scale. You get pros and cons with that. Crazy lines at check-in/out and maybe the neglected ""room ready"" alert, but also bellhops who move fast and a continuously line of taxis for you catch (versus the 10 minute wait at other quieter hotels).",May 2023,278,4.0
Perfect stay at the best hotel in the world,"Booked the room with the garden view for 1 night and honestly it‚Äôs the best hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed in. From check in, to all the members of staff, the food, the free mini bar in the room, the view and the swimming pool on the top floor, everything was perfect. It was also my partners birthdays and my requests for arranging a cake to be brought to the room was carried out with no problems whatsoever and at no extra charge. The beds are comfortable, everything was spotless, and we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay. Value for money is absolutely justified as every detail is perfect down to the last centimetre.",May 2023,"1,319",5.0

Excellent,"Our stay here lived up to the expectations. Stayed in a Deluxe King Sky View room on level 43 with fantastic views of the city. Room is spacious, comfortable and clean. Two enormous TVs in the room were great for the short time we were winding down in the room. The pool on the roof is everything you expect. Incredible views and experience. Also generally a great spot to relax and unwind. Staff across the complex, whether at the hotel, pool or restaurants were all excellent. Very helpful, kind and efficient. With the pool, casino, shops, restaurants and more, this is a great place to stay in Singapore.",June 2023,19,5.0
Must stay if you visit Singapore,"When the lady at front desk found out I left Singapore 25 years ago as an ESPN sports anchor and lecturer at NUS, now returned as a professor to give a seminar presentation, she worked with a manager very hard to upgrade our two rooms to one beautiful two-bedroom suite on the 43rd floor facing the bay. Our family really enjoyed the stay at Marina Bay Sands that is second to none. Your hospitality made our stay in Singapore the highlight of our entire trip in Southeast Asia. We will definitely come back.",May 2023,3,5.0
Disappointing sanitary standards,"The hotel did not live up to its expectations. The rooms were OK, and everything was fine until ants started showing up in our room. Started off with one single ant in the morning, and at night the same day we had a trail of ants below a pillow on the bed. Totally unacceptable. We also noticed that sheets were tidied up but not changed for a couple days. Slow front desk.Very questionable sanitary standards. Horrible bang for the bucks. Think twice before booking.",June 2023,1,1.0
Amazing Stay,"Clean rooms, great view and express check-out. But the highlight of our stay is the infinity pool. The service is amazing. I would like to commend Dennis and Maricor at the pool area for the great service.",May 2023,1,5.0
Overrated,The smell of urine and visible molds in the the bathroom are disgusting.  Cigarette butts in the balcony.  Stains on the carpet.. room is dusting.  We asked to change the room but they couldn‚Äôt accommodate but offer to send the cleaning crew.  Horrendous experience,June 2023,1,1.0
You‚Äôll be left tired and hungry,Terrible service‚Ä¶.The MBS is an incredible place there is no two ways about it‚Ä¶however my wife and I arrived at the hotel at around 9am  after 13hr flight. We were told that our rooms were not ready and we had to wait for a text message letting us know that they were ready. After several hours of waiting they still weren‚Äôt ready and told me I had to continue to wait. And it was possible that they weren‚Äôt going to be ready until 3pm. We tried to get some food by the pool however was turned away (even though it was open and other people were sitting in there).  I stated to the staff at the front desk that we were extremely jet lagged and we were turned away at one of the restaurants. I find this incredibly hard to believe that an establishment like the MBS don‚Äôt allow check in before 3pm even though there are multiple long haul flights landing early in the morning. The staff weren‚Äôt prepared to offer any type of compensation either so we and the wife just sat in the lobby and waited. Bored tired and hungry. I wouldn‚Äôt not recommend it here.,June 2023,1,1.0
A heartfelt thank you to Marina Bay Sands,"I have had the pleasure of staying at Marina Bay Sands hotel on several occasions and every single time the stay exceeds expectations. The warm welcome, great hospitality and the staff's willingness to help solve issues is outstanding. The rooms are always clean and the views are breathtaking. The wide range of restaurants in the hotel cater to different situations, always something to enjoy. A heartfelt thank you to Marina Bay Sands!",May 2023,1,5.0
mixed,"wanted to stay here having visited singapore a few years ago . had booked the roof restaurant well in advance as it gets busy. This was the one disappointment. Food just ok , service fine but for the price , which is expensive by any comparison - the italian restaurant was more akin to a cross between bella italia and an american diner - would not bother again- hotel service and room were absolutely fine - it is a mad busy very large hotel .Breakfast service on the roof was good if very very busy.",April 2023,25,4.0
Awesome experience!,"Very friendly and accomodating staff, from check-in till check out it was all smooth and fast. Had a room with a great view, and they even sent something in the room upon knowing we are celebrating a special occasion, very thoughtful indeed.Arts Science Future World was a good place for kids to enjoy.Kids had a great time in the infinity pool, staff are all friendly, approachable and attentive to all our needs.

"A good stay, not a great stay","The hotel is undoubtedly wow in style, architecture and size. The observation deck and pool are amazing. Our room was huge, well appointed and had a great view of the city. The water, juice etc. are replenished daily. We didn't eat in any of the hotel's restaurants. Our only criticism is the bed was extremely firm and we had 3 uncomfortable night's sleep and sore backs/necks in the morning. Our overall impression - we preferred The Clan in Chinatown, where we stayed our first 4 nights, for its ambience, style and location.",April 2023,52,4.0
Infinity pool with a view.,The infinity pool on the roof was amazing! Breathtaking views during the day and especially at night. Great poolside service with excellent drinks and food.

The rooms were very nice and comfortable.,March 2023,1,5.0
Lovely place to go whatever you plan to do!,"Whether it‚Äôs to soak up the Marina Bay cityscapes and the waterfront, shop the most expensive branded items Singapore has to offer, to visit art and science museum with young children, eat all the delicacies (at a marked up price) at Rasapura masters in B2 level Marina Bay Sands or to go up to the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel Skydeck for a stunning 360 view of Singapore, this is a must do.I took the Taxi from airport (SGD 24) with my family to Marina Bay Sands, but you may chose to do the MRT. Food at the food court was fabulous. Don‚Äôt forget to try Chendol (a desert). Wet to Art and Science Museum to see the Audi Exhibition. Others we did not fancy. Shopped and walked the waterfront.Went to sky deck. Fabulous views.Then back to airport. Best way to spend a 10 hour transit.",April 2023,14,5.0
Great service and staffs! Room condition could be better,"The overall service was excellent! We were able to get an early check in, which was more than we could ask for. As for room condition, the room that was assigned to us was in Tower 3, and wasn't in the best shape. I understand that the Tower 2 is under renovation or is renovated already. Hope that for our next visit we could also get a room that's gone under reservation. All the staffs were friendly, location was great. My parents loved the swimming pool.

Bucket List,"The MBS was on our bucket list, so we took the plunge.  Yeah the hotel is expensive but for us it was a once in a lifetime trip.  Could have stayed at the fours seasons for less but it doesn't have a 57th flr infinity pool and the cool light show.Booked a garden room view and we really enjoyed.  Nice balcony and a great view of the skypark, and as a bonus a great view of the light show in the park.  The room was nice with a huge TV led (70"").  Bed was comfy and a practical layout, but nothing special.  Minibar (non-alcoholic) was also included in our rate and was refreshed daily.  Also, bottled water was provided daily - we got at least 6 bottles a day, and you could ask for more if needed.Infinity pool was amazing, with a breathtaking view of the city during and day and night.  Pool staff were super friendly and it was great that only hotel guests could use the pool.  Having said that, the pool can get super busy so we decided to visit the pool first thing in the morning and end of the evening 9pm and it wasn't busy at all.  Very nice !  We used the gym on the 55th floor - amazing views of the city.  Lots of modern equipment and the use of a sauna, steamroll, and hot pool in the change room area.We didn't dine at MBS, but instead wanted to try the Singapore street food, so a quick taxi to chinatown (Maxwell or Lau Pau Sat) with a huge selection of food.  The mall in the foodcourt is very good too, if you want to eat in air conditioned comfort :).  For us, the MBS was a super convenient location to explore Singapore.If it's on your bucket list, just do it.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at MBS.Bonus:  We were celebrating our anniversary and one evening, they provided us with a small box of chocolates and some delicious dessert.",March 2023,166,5.0
Not Worth It,"The only reason we spent $500 for a night was to go in the famous infinity pool.  It was not worth it.  The hotel has thousands of people in it, feels like you are in Los Vegas in one of the big gambling casinos.  There is a food court that again, thousands of people, not just guests, go to eat.  If I had not stayed here, I would have always wondered what it was like at the infinity pool.   The room was average with a view of the gardens.",March 2023,259,3.0

Once in a lifetime splurge on VIP package worth it,"My siblings and I booked a surprise stay at the MBS for my parents as their wedding anniversary gift, and decided to go all out on the High Life Package in the Sands Premier Suite for a special once-in-a-lifetime experience.

They showed great professionalism, were always willing to assist with our queries and requests, and truly, truly went above and beyond to make my parent‚Äôs  anniversary stay at the MBS a very special and memorable occasion for our whole family.

One for Instagram,"We stayed here for two nights on our way back to a trip to Sydney.  It is a lovely hotel.  Pretty massive, reminding us a bit of Vegas (no real surprise given the owners).  Check in was pretty smooth, although it took us some time as the assistant was trying to get us a room higher up, which she succeeded in doing.Our room (2910) in Tower 3 had a great view over Gardens by the Bay, so we watched the light show from our balcony one evening.  You could also see the final corners of the F1 circuit if you leant out a bit.The room itself was lovely, large and very clean.  Easy controls for the lights and curtains.  The biggest TV we have ever seen in a hotel room, although there were not too many western channels.  They seemed to be automated to reduce air con usage when we left the room.The bathroom was nice too, with great toiletries.  No bath, just a nice shower.The beds were pretty hard, but we slept OK so didn't mention it.There is free water, soft drinks and snacks plus an espresso machine in the room.There are two sets of lifts per tower.  They service up to floor 34 and floor 34 and above.  If you want to go to the rooftop, you can go up from say 29 to 34 and then change lifts for the remainder of the journey.The hotel and adjoining shopping centre have an unbelievable range of options for food.  Breakfast was included in our package, and I would recommend you avoid Spago unless you really need to eat on the rooftop and go to Rise on the ground floor instead.  The choice at the buffet is phenomenal.  We even had dinner there one day.  If you don't want to visit the pool, you are probably in the wrong hotel.  Apart from being an engineering marvel, it is so amazing to be in an infinity pool 57 floors up.  The area is divided in two with the pool facing the city and some other loungers in the gardens on the side facing the Singapore Strait.  This is handy as the sun rises on one side and sets on the other, so you can move around to find some shade if you want to.Hotel guests also get free access to the Observation Deck.The hotel is also excellent value for money, given the cost to construct it.",May 2023,933,5.0

Super impressed,"I was so impressed with this resort. Having visited ce la vi and spago in the past as a tourist I thought the hotel would be overcrowded however the stay felt extremely exclusive you have a separate elevator to access your room and also access to the famous infinity pool. The breakfast was also excellent. The staff also went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant stay. This hotel is centrally located and you have access to the mall, Marina and gardens by the bay. I would definitely stay here again.",July 2022,11,5.0

Best Hotel EVER,"We stayed here for three nights at the end of March, 2023.  Everything was phenomenal from the customer service to the frozen grapes by the pool.  I have never been more impressed by a hotel.  I even bought the scent that they push into the elevator - it smells so delightful.  If you‚Äôre ever in Singapore, this hotel is a must!  You will not be disappointed!  The breakfast buffet is also so delicious, with foods from all over the world and the best fresh pomegranate!",March 2023,18,5.0
Stay once for the pool!,"We were transiting through Singapore on the way to Indonesia, and decided to try the Marina bay for three nights.  Worth staying just to experience the rooftop pool, which is an amazing engineering accomplishment!  Also a central location to visit the Botanic Gardens, Chinatown, National Museum etc.  This is an enormous casino/convention hotel and so it needs to be judged that way.  The food and bars were really mediocre, but still glad we stayed.",April 2023,28,3.0

Most famous hotel in Singapore experience,"Great hotel but it felt like everything is disorganized, maybe it was because the hotel looked like full capacity, breakfast we had to wait 40min in-line, the sky view pool was packed, hotel room are good enough",June 2023,4,4.0
An Overall Good Experience,"We were guests of the hotel for 8 nights. My partner had a conference in Singapore that was in the convention centre annexed to the hotel, so Marina Bay Sands was a logical choice.  It is well located to the Gardens by the Bay, the Science museum,  the subway,  the promenade, and, of course, the incredible stores and multiple restaurants that are in the attached mall. We were located in Tower 3. Views were fantastic. We were able to observe the light show on he Bay from our room. The room was well appointed, spotlessly clean, and house keeping was excellent. Check in was challenging. Reception seemed unprepared and understaffed for the number of delegates arriving. We had occasion to need the concierge and had a positive experience. Our rate included breakfast at either Rise or Wolfgang Puck's restaurant on the rooftop; we chose the latter. The food options were good. We typically chose from the a la carte menu with a foray into the buffet. Service was uneven.We also had drinks at the rooftop bar on arrival. Drinks were overpriced, poorly made, and it was crowded and noisy to the point of being really unpleasant. Service was awful.",May 2023,"1,782",4.0
MBS with Kids for a perfect weekend‚Ä¶happy Father‚Äôs Day,"This is my first visit to the most infamous hotel in SingaporeUpon arrival surprised by the sheer crowns of guest at lobby, at lobby , lines were extreme long, water and lolly pops where served at lines and I was checking in with wife and 2 kidsLobby manager pull us from the line and ask us  to the star lounge i notice mainly for guest who are seniors or with kidsWas served very quickly by Jennifer Yeoh at the star lounge, the service was very quick and very very attention. It was the small gestures of simple ‚ÄúMR chew I guess the kids maybe tired from the trip, allow me to quickly get a room from your family to settle down and take a shower‚Äù‚Ä¶ this I would say are simple hospitality thoughts which go a long long way from our experience.mThe location of MBS was great, integrated SMRT, Mall, Food, the Park‚Ä¶ for morning walks and etcThe room view‚Ä¶ excellent‚Ä¶baby cot was ready, only surprise no bathtubThe famous pool at 57th floor was more a dipping pool than a swimming pool but nevertheless my family had a splash ü§≠üí™.

Special cuz of Pool,I was super excited to stay in MBS due to so much popularity I heard of the hotel. The lobby is very busy and crowded. The rooftop pool is the highlight.

Family weekend staycation,"Booked two rooms, a premier (with bath tub) and a deluxe (no bathtub)room .Both as lovely and spacious. Room is big enough to accommodate an extra bed.Service is great and attentive. The only thing is the crowd at check in on weekend. Suggest to check in earlier and to pick up keys when it‚Äôs available.",June 2023,301,5.0
Best hotel experience of our lives!,"I booked this hotel for two nights for our honeymoon and it was the best hotel experience, out of all our world travels!The staff are on an entirely different level of professionalism, kindness and very sincere. When our room was made up, the kind person who made up out room wrapped up my phone charge cord with a nice leather strap to make it look ni e for when we were back from the pool. Thank you!! The rooftop pool, is even more amazing than in the photos on the internet... its actually a magical experience. The hotel is perfectly located for so very many things and attached to the absolutely wonderful mall.Cannot thank all the staff enough for all they did for us and their professionalism.",June 2023,52,5.0
Way too expensive,If you have money to waste them this is the place for you. We paid ¬£150 for a buffet that tasted horrible and was fish heavy. I was really excited about coming to Singapore but it is just too expensive from the room to the food. Everything is massively overpriced. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt come back.,July 2023,2,1.0
Must visit in Singapore. Great service and facilities.,"Fascinating views anywhere you look. We got a room on 18th floor facing the merlion. What can be better! It was fireworks show that was amazing to see from our floor to ceiling window! Room is spacious with electric curtains and comfortable bed with nice pillows. TV is like you are in the cinema - huge! You can see a care of staff in everything. We ordered food in room service - all was served on a special table with a lot of condiments. Pool. Place to visit for sure. Water was a bit cold, but still we enjoyed and shot some great photos. There‚Äôs a jacuzzi as well - you can see other side of the building with a see view! Check in lady was extremely kind and helpful. She talk with our kids to make sure they are happy- they gave special book for each kid. Lovely experience! Only advice if you‚Äôre planning to dine in restaurants there you need to book in advance. Always busy. Thanks for great stay!",July 2023,7,5.0

5 star luxury experience in the garden city,"I have never experienced anything less than perfect during all my stays here. The rooms, amenities, restaurants and shops are world class standard. The sheer size of the property and location itself makes it a prime attraction for locals and tourists alike. The must visit place is the infinity pool which looks absolutely amazing whether day or night. I think Marina Bay Sands is the best luxury hotel you can find in Singapore.",June 2023,14,5.0

A night at MBS we will never forget,"After 4yrs of calling Singapore home, it was time to relocate back home. We decided to spend a night at Marina Bay Sand after the kids told me they wanted to visit the infinity pool. The premium Service team at MBS made our stay a memorable and enjoyable one. From the time of registration to checking out, they were there for us. They gave gifts to our kids, booked us a executive taxi home and even checked on us to see that we arrived home safely. Thank you to the team especially Joana, Eunice and Daniel. We will see you soon. You made our stay enjoyable and Memorable.",July 2023,1,5.0
Not worth the money,"Building is iconic, service is mostly outstanding and rooms are nice. But the price level is just not justified. One night is ok so you have access to the pool then; and that is the thing in this hotel. Don‚Äôt take breakfast, because it‚Äôs just a chaos.",June 2023,117,2.0
Excellent service,It was always one unforgettable experience to stay at Marina Bay Sands.  The place is exteaordinary and MBS team always provide us with an excellent service especially bellmen Joey and Edgardo. They made sure all our luggages are secured and they were both very professional yet very friendly and comforting.  Kuddos as well to Richard of IRD as he was also very helpful.,June 2023,2,5.0
The most amazing suite!,Our first time staying at MBS and Kesh at the front desk made sure it was comfortable and memorable. He was quite efficient and quick with the check in process- while still making time to chat up my toddler aged 1.5 years. Shanmu helped out during the stay and was available promptly. Overall the staff was ready to help out with anything that we needed. The infinity pool was exceptional as we expected. They had a fun session for the kids (painting the tote bag). The views from pretty much everywhere in the hotel were fantastic. We were on level 51. The suite was extremely comfortable! Space was generous for my toddler to sprint around.,May 2023,2,5.0
