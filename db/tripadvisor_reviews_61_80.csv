Almost perfect honeymoon trip,"This could be a long overdue review since we stayed at Marina Bay Sands Singapore last 31st of July which was our most awaited honeymoon destination. We booked for 3 nights stay to a premium room. Everything was planned perfectly until we arrived in the hotel. There was a flocked of people everywhere, we don’t have any idea what was going on upon entering the door. We approached a gentleman wearing a black suit that we wanted to checked in and we found out that we could not check in because the hotel was having a system down. My husband and I wanted to melt down coming from a long flight only to found out that we could not get our room upon arriving the hotel. It was around half past 3 o clock when we arrived. I have never seen a hotel so huge, so crowded, so chaotic and there were no seats available.  They asked us to give our contact details and they will call us once the system is back. My husband and I decided to go out and relax somewhere nearby for dinner. But it was around 10pm when we came back to the hotel and nobody from the hotel contacted us. We approached the concierge and directed us to the reception lady LJ or RJ. We were so furious and totally devastated for our first day experience in the hotel but the receptionist has sincerely apologizing to us and we really felt her genuine demeanour. She was the only one who said sorry to us for what was going on at that time. Despite of the hoarse voice she has for maybe apologizing to everyone at that time, we can feel the heartfelt service to us. She made us feel special even more when we told her that we were there for our honeymoon. She was really great despite of that situation she was very calm, composed  and exceptionally wonderful. She upgraded our room to a suite room which has a very stunning view of Singapore from daytime to night. She even offered us a $300 credit to the room for the experience recovery which was not really necessary but my husband say to just accept it anyway. It seems that our disappointment has slowly faded away for the great service that we experience in general.  The pool and the view was amazing!!! it is a huge property and like a one stop shop destination that must go to. We love the food in Lavo and Spago though it was so so difficult to reserved for a seat, we managed to get a slot. The view on top was perfect for a couple. I still want to go back again despite the hiccups. Probably a different arrival experience, a better one without too much crowd but still an exceptional service from the staff.  Thank you Singapore and MBS.",July 2022,2,4.0
"Our room was out of this world, the place to stay is Marina Bay!","I visited Marina Bay for 2 nights on our way to Bali. Lots to share to help everyone make their decision if this is the place to stay in Singapore (we believe it is.)Food - visited Spago and Cest la vie bar. Be clear when you book Spago if you want the fine dining as we made this mistake and we couldn’t then get a reservation at the fine dining as it was fully booked and they have a strict dress code so my boyfriend in shorts and a shirt wouldn’t have been allowed in anyway. The food was okay but we didn’t get to experience the fine dining which I’m sure would be out of this world. Pool - way more impressive by night than by day. I love that there are different chill spaces like day beds, cabanas, sun beds etc… and that the pool and jacuzzis are open until 11pm at night. The hotel also allows guests to wonder in their robes and slippers which is nice touch, it creates a relaxed vibe in what is a busy 5 star hotel with global recognition.Room - we booked a room on the highest floors so we were 49 (57 is the pool and 55 is the gym and spa so we were pretty high.) Our room was HUGE, it had 2 x 75 inch TV’s, a super king bed, a sofa living area and a huge bathroom. As we’d paid for being on a high floor, we had an amazing view.Overall - well worth it for a couple of nights, any longer than that would be too much in my opinion and it is very expensive.",September 2022,538,5.0
An average hotel,"Stayed here as it seems the right thing to do when in Singapore, we were underwhelmed and thought the hotel was over rated, had to book even to have a drink in a bar, Ce la Vie deposit and minimum spend was extortionate, room was ok brekkie average, hotel is to big and lacks the personal touch.",September 2022,74,3.0
Excellent service from Premium Services,"Our stay were well taken care by the outstanding Premium Services team. Special thanks to Shataz, Nicholas and Mac for the seamless check in and check out. They were patient and professional. They provided direct contact number so that our needs could be attended promptly and it definitely made our stay amazing and smooth! Definitely recommend to book your room/event at mbs with Premium Services. Thank you team!",September 2022,2,5.0
Amazing Infinity pool!,"We book Marina Bay Sands, due to the pool.... and it is indeed an amazing pool! We love it!Besides that, staff was always friendly and efficient.Room was perfectly clean and we loved the room balcony with an amazing view over the Gardens by the Bay,The price for a night is very expensive and does not include breakfast.... we pay the pool.",August 2022,31,5.0
6 Star Experience!!,"Amazing hotel with 6 star service!! The staff were fantastic, they made our ""sisters get-away"" extra special with their warmth and professional hospitality. In particular, we would like to acknowledge Gai, Room Guest Services - KJ, Infinity Pool lifeguard - and Jessie, Reception check-in Services. They all went out of their way to provide us with exceptional service and made us feel very welcomed. Can't wait to go back!!",September 2022,1,5.0
Great stay,"I enjoyed our stay at Marina Bay Sands, our room was a Garden View which was excellent. We could watch the Supertree show from our balcony which was a really cool experience because you could see the whole thing, as opposed to when you're actually at the Supertree show you only get a partial view.The staff were all very friendly and attentive, Nicholas who checked us in was excellent, he was so helpful and made sure we knew everything about the hotel that we needed to. Candy in the gift shop was also wonderful, so friendly and helpful.The pool is an awesome experience, as it wasn't peak season we got to go a few times. They bring around complimentary ice-creams too so definitely keep an eye out for them. You also get access to the SkyPark Observation deck. It can be a little clunky to get to as you have to go through the same elevator as the non-guests and its separate from the rest of the hotel but its a great inclusion you should definitely take advantage of.",September 2022,209,5.0
Great experience at MBS,"It is my 3rd time staying at Mbs, it is good to be back here. I would like to compliment a particular staff, lifeguard Ryan. He has gone extra mile by volunteering to help us take photos, mingling with guests and helping his colleagues. He is a gem.",September 2022,2,5.0
Beautiful Hotel,Singapore is such a beautiful place to go and the hotel was great. It has very nice view and the facilities was just nice. Its been so long since my wife and I travelled but there was a nice lady name Sha helped us at the reception answering all out enquiries. It was a lovely stay and friendly people around.,March 2023,1,4.0
Amazing hotel!!,Fantastic hotel with a huge variety of food outlets and activities. Great rooms with great views across the bay and bay gardens. Go for a high floor room to get the views. Also recommend KOMA Japanese restaurant.,March 2023,122,5.0
Huge hotel complex with a great view,"We stayed here for 4 nights. We had no idea that the restaurants would be so busy and it would be so hard to book once we were here, so book ahead! We ate in both Lavo and Cest la vie and had good meals in both.. the prices are extortionate though for what you are eating. Cest la vie’s menu is pretty limited too. We had a drink afterward in their sky bar which was really nice with that great view. Breakfast the first day, what a queue! We had to wait half an hour.. one of their restaurants, Rise is being refurbished so one less restaurant for breakfast… (my advice come early) we skipped it the next day but had had it the last 2 days and the queues were better but we were earlier. Breakfast was ok, nothing special. The staff are all lovely, we didn’t encounter not one unhelpful or miserable member. The pool - well what can I say about that big pool with that great view, not bad waiter service and comfy loungers.. just lovely. People were out there until late at night relaxing and having food on the loungers. The room was spacious, great showers and plenty of products.. the bed was pretty hard though and sadly the complimentary fridge only had a few cans of sugary fizzy drinks.. we left a note for our housekeeper to swap them for sugar free drinks but no luck.. I tried again for our last day and bingo two coke zeros.. We thought we’d try the casino one evening and what a palava, passports, your Singapore entry form then their face recognition couldn’t match me to my passport .. any how we nearly have up as we are not gamblers, we just wanted to have a quick go at roulette. Any how we finally got in.. it was ok… similar to the Hippodrome in leciester square being leant on and pushed out the way so players could put their bets on.. It has a walk way to get to the Garden by the Bay which was very handy. We could also see the light shows, one from our room and one from the Cest la vie bar. The hotel is massive… shops, museum, theatre the lot. It’s spotless and seems really well run. We had a very pleasant 4 night stay.",February 2023,591,4.0
Singapore or sing for more,"The Marina Bay Sands is a beautiful hotel, but the rooms are over priced and disappointing. The roof top infinity pool should be heated, but its not and as many guests ventured in to get that must have photo, the look on their faces was priceless. At the prices they charge here the Marina Bay Sands should and could do better. It was an enjoyable few days but we left feeling somewhat disappointed.",February 2023,14,4.0
Be prepared to queue for everything,Room was very nice and tastefully decorated.Hotel was very clean and staff we had contact with were helpful and friendly Pool cold and full of people taking selfies although it obviously is an “experience” Our issue was with the constant need to queue for everything including breakfast - over 30 mins. Unable to get anywhere to eat or drink in hotel or attached shopping complex unless you have booked  - even then we struggled to find anywhere two days ahead. Nowhere in hotel you can sit and just get a drink when raining - never had to book to get into a bar!So many people and not enough basic facilities Queues at 6am to check out tooDefinitely an experience but won’t be returning,March 2023,77,3.0
Excellent staff,"This hotel is an excellent place to stay in Singapore. Extremely cooperative and friendly staff. Xavier, head of concierge at the hotel, made sure that my husband and I have comfortable stay. He arranged everything for us, from offering extended checkout to storing the luggage.",February 2023,1,5.0
Great experience!,"Our family enjoyed the stay!  We went for Frozen musical.  It is a right decision to stay at MBS as it is convenient.  Easy access to theatre, shops, restaurants, MRT... We like the infinity pool, but it is windy & cold for my 9yo daughter.  If you bring children there, be prepared to keep them warm.  Restaurants are always busy, it is best to make reservation up front.  We drove & the Valet parking service (daily rate with multiple entries) is very useful (because the carpark is quite a distance) & reasonably priced.  Easy to get staff assistance at Tower 1 lobby area & Tower 3 pick up / drop off points.  Staff are very friendly, helpful & well-trained. We were assigned a Premium Serivces agent during check-in & felt being taken care!",February 2023,1,5.0
Iconic,"It was always an ambition to stay here and finally achieved it. A lovely hotel and just our style, modern & comfortable. The roof top pool is a must and it’s lovely to lay by the pool and take a dip and enjoy the view. The gym is small for the size of the hotel but it always had space when we visited. The buffet restaurant was good but nearly always busy. We were in a suite but unlike other similar hotels they didn’t have an executive lounge for snacks etc,shame!",January 2023,"1,427",5.0
Special to Guna at Marina Bay Sand infinity pool,I stay  Marina Bay sand hotel for 3 days 2 night. First day when I came to the pool and intended to order some bites and drink for my family. I raise my hand and waited for about half an hour but no one serve me even they saw. After that Guna came here and serve us. We ordered few times and we was far away from the counter to order. And he still patiently serve us even we have a lot request.  2nd day when we come. Still is him who serve us. Wanted to know how come no others ppl working while I sees most of them are just walking around without serving customer. Wanted to give him a very good thumb up. And service was really good.,February 2023,3,5.0
mixed experience,"On the positive side, the hotel has stunning city skyline views and easy access to many of Singapore's top attractions. However, the room is a little bit outdated. The hotel's restaurants and other facilities were also quite expensive, making it challenging to enjoy all the hotel had.",December 2022,75,4.0
MBS - one of the nicest & unique places of the world,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands again for 4 days. From arrival to departure, it was a single experience. We already knew the luxurious house. This time we were able to get to know a unique service. We were picked up directly after arrival at the gate and accompanied to the hotel, had a limousine - it couldn't be better. Once we arrived at the hotel, we were already welcomed by an excellently trained employee who took over all the formalities for us and accompanied us to our suite. Here we were made aware of various things. For the duration of our stay, this employee took care of everything, including the luggage that did not arrive in Singapore. That was a unique service and we were thrilled from the first moment - it couldn't be better and we thank you very much for that. We can only recommend this wonderful house. We can afford this house, should definitely try it out and will not be disappointed at all.",February 2023,5,5.0
Fantastic infinity pool with a great view!,"An overnight stay in the hotel is worthwhile just to be able to enjoy the inifinity pool with its mega view. The service staff is extremely friendly. A special thank you to Shirly from Pool Service for her super friendly and attentive service.My recommendation for breakfast: Toast Box. They serve a Singaporean breakfast of Traditional Kaya Toast or Peanut Butter Thick Toast, soft-boiled eggs, and Nanyang Coffee at Toast Box. Very special and yummi.",February 2023,1,4.0
Amazing Stay.,We decided to celebrate our 45th Wedding Anniversary in our favorite city in our favorite hotel.  Thank you for making it so special and a great celebration for us.Your staff throughout MBS are amazing.  Everything about MBS is luxurious. I will make mention of Mark Anthony your luxury service manager who added a few things to make us feel extra special.  And to Lee Roy in the Spago Bar Thank-you for our nightly entertainment watching you make amazing cocktails for patrons while sitting at the bar. We definitely recommend staying at MBS and hopefully will be back at the end of the year. Once again Thank you.,January 2023,238,5.0
New Renovated Club Room,"Nice renovated room, most inside the room is automatic, no need to slot in the card is auto on and off. Once you enter the room, the light is auto-on, window curtain is auto-open. Light and aircon are.adjustable.The toilet is impressive, it's auto heated with back washer.

Better than best!  Still awesome after 10 years.,Better than best!   Still so awesome returning after 10 years!  Romantic weekend trip and we loved the front desk and all round service. Infinity pool was so chill and not crowded at all on a weekend.  Partner loved it!!,February 2023,15,5.0
Opulence galore,"Where do I begin? The extravagant nature of this hotel has to be seen to be believed. The courteous nature of every single staff member, the luxurious decor of the rooms, the view from said room, the infinity edge pool, everything was breath taking. Yes it’s expensive, but in my opinion money well spent if you want to treat yourself.My thesaurus ran out of superlatives to describe the brilliance of our stay",February 2023,58,5.0
Singapore’s Best- a truly iconic hotel,"First time to visit Singapore and the stay in Marina Bay sands is the best. Staff greets warmly with a smile. They communicate well. From the bell service, room attendant to front office staff. A huge thanks to Mr. Andre for a fantastic check in. He is kind enough to upgrade us to a suite room with a choice of view. We chose to stay facing the gardens by the bay. Mr. Jerry also did a warm check out. Staff are attentive. Room is clean and comfortably perfect. Highlight of our stay is the iconic infinity pool at the top of the hotel, truly worthy to end our stay at Singapore. Wish to be back soon.",February 2023,8,5.0
Marina Bay Sands Serious Disappointment.,1 would be too high a rating for this place. Huge overrated attraction. Was meant to be the highlight of our Far East Tour. Accept that the weather is an uncontrolled animal. But a huge venue who could not offer us a drink anywhere. Poor. Save your money and go to Raffles Hotel instead. Excellent service. Wonderful drinks. MBS is a circus.,February 2023,17,1.0
Meets the high expectations,"There are some places you book and you have a clear idea of what you think it will be like - marina bay sands delivered on our expectations. Yes it’s pricey but you’re paying for more than just a room. Views are incredible, we had views of gardens by the bay from our room, the infinity pool was a brilliant experience and having the whole Marina Bay Area on your doorstep is the perfect location.",August 2022,179,5.0
Most amazing view of Singapore skyline,"We stayed at Marina bay sands for 3 nights. The hotel has some of the best night clubs of Singapore. It has a shopping mall, casino, multiple international restaurants and is well connected to metro station. We enjoyed every bit our stay there with most cherished experience being swim in the infinity pool which provides a unique view of the Singapore skyline. It's highly recommended to reserve the table at the night clubs and restaurants in advance as it's difficult to get a seat on spot. There is also some construction work going on in tower 2 so one might hear some noise therefore its recommended to get a city view room at tower 3",February 2023,2,5.0
Amazing Stay!,"MBS is THE place to stay if you are visiting Singapore for the first time. The service is exemplary! The lobby is huge and always kept clean and spotless. We arrived very early and the front desk agent who checked us in was very pleasant and courteous. Our check-in experience was very seamless. We stayed in room 4001 (tower 3, floor 40) and had an AMAZING city view, at night you can see the skyline light up at night and you can get a good view of the water show every night. The room attendant who serviced our room was incredible. They were efficient and timely everyday, BIG thank you to the housekeeping staff for all that they do for a property this size. The rooftop view and poor are amazing of course! The staff were courteous and patient. We had breakfast at Spago almost every morning and the staff were very friendly and welcomed us back every morning. Our checkout experience was very seamless as well. We were assisted by Manu who was very friendly and kind. A perfect way to end our stay! Again, I would highly recommend staying at MBS!",January 2023,11,5.0
Above and Beyond our expectation - the excellent services and experience,"Six nights at Marina Bay Sands {MBS} - the Team and staff, are what make our stay at the hotel memorable. Our Deluxe Room is spacious & daily housekeeping is great. The Infinity pool's view lives up to its reputation, but the staff at the pool, makes the experience even more memorable - just to name a couple: the lifeguard Ryan and MBS Ambassador Catherine. The Breakfast Buffet at the RISE Restaurant - Incredible, with lots of varieties, and choices, to meet the taste of all Travelers from around the world. From the restaurant maitre d', Paula, to waiters like Christian, managers like Amo & Raja, AND all the chefs' team at each of the buffet stations, they work hard to make sure the customers are happy with their experience at the RISE restaurant. Concierge Desk is fully staffed in order to meet the needs of the Travelers who stay at MBS and they are very helpful in providing precise information for Travelers, like us, in order to make their visit to Singapore even more memorable.",January 2023,4,5.0
Come for the pool but stay for the excellent service,"Marina Bay Sands is a hotel that needs no introduction. Many stay for the pool alone and frankly that is a perfect reason to stay here. People often ask if the pool is as nice as it looks...and yes, it is. It is indeed a reason enough to stay here. What really surprised me about MBS though is the service. For such an enormous Vegas sizes property the service is fantastic. Everyone I interacted with across the entire hotel was lovely and happy to assist. Guest services and housekeeping was also excellent. Is it normally my kind of hotel, no..it vaguely looks like a bit like an airport terminal, albeit a very high end one. I'm not going to speak negatively of the hotel for that because it's a stylistic choice and doesn't reflect on the quality of the hotel in anyway, which is lovely. If you're coming to Singapore for the first time, or fifth, I can certainly recommend MBS as an icon and the excellent service is the cherry on top.",December 2022,143,5.0
Fantastic stay - incredible,"Spent a day here at the end of a cruise but could have spent a week! Amazing facility , super staff . Views are dynamite from the rooms, but to top it off a rooftop infinity pool to die for ! Di spend the extra money snd stay here, a perfect location and truly 5 star",January 2023,2,5.0
"Iconic hotel in a superb location, not worth the price tag sadly","My wife and I stayed here for my 35th Birthday. Being basically THE iconic landmark of Singapore, we had high expectations for the stay and ultimately were let down. Although the façade and much of the shopping/main MBS area exudes a 5-star resort feel, the actual rooms are extremely basic. Nothing about our stay was ""5-star"", for what the final bill was, I would expect a lot more in terms of room amenities, bed quality, overall service, resort perks, etc. Honestly at the end of the day, I just felt like another number in the que. The 57th floor pool is nice for the view only, after that wears off, there really is no substance at all. The menu you can order from is tiny (even though there are 3 restaurants up there, you can't order from them at the pool....what), the water is seriously frigid, and the drink menu is lacking. There is really no atmosphere at all up there either, from music to events, to theme, to....anything. You just look at the view and pay  for overpriced drinks and food until you've had enough. The good thing is, there is plenty of options for F&B /shopping in the area, so no matter what you are looking for you are bound to find it, it is centrally located  so you can get to anywhere you want to go from there. Overall I would not recommend staying here, for what they charge and what you get, it really not worth it. There are several extremely nice hotels/stays in Singapore very much more worth you stay than here.",September 2022,27,2.0
Our Dream Anniversary,"After planning this trip for over 20 years, to finally make it happen was a dream come true for me and a dream vacation for my lovely wife. It was our 32nd anniversary holiday which we had planned for over a year. Right from the start, getting picked up at the airport (getting met at the gate lounge was a new first for us), our introduction to Marina Bay Sands by Nicholas Len and the staff was a huge level up for us. Our room overlooking the ocean was on the 47th floor and to say the views - both during the day and at night - where spectacular would be an understatement. The countless number of photos of the view we took during our stay will never get old. Our dining experience that first night at Mr Puck's establishment in the mall was amazing. I had it on my list to enjoy a steak from Cut and neither of our meals disappointed. In fact, we had so much food (the breads and that awesome marbled butter ...) we had to admit defeat at take the remains of our meals back to the room. We tried both Rise and Spago for breakfast and while we enjoyed both, our favourite was definitely Rise with its many more options.There was so much to see and do around the Marina Bay Sands complex that it took us over four days before we actually made it to some other parts of Singapore, so we will definitely be going back and this time we won't be lulled into staying the whole time by their wonderful roof top pool with endless views, or their countless eating establishments with endless varieties to suit every taste, or their multitude of shopping options, or their easy access to parks and walks around the bay ...Once again, thank you very much Marina Bay Sands for making our dream trip a dream come true.",December 2022,10,5.0
An experience which worth to try it,"Sometime you are thinking a bout the life time experience . This is one of it. Leaving aside the size of the hotel, with 3 towers, you have a good connection the one of the largest malls in Singapore. Breakfast is perfect, internet is working fine. Quality of the sleep is perfect. Swimming pool is a life time experience.",October 2022,39,5.0
Tower 2 Floor 57 Bar,"We were going to go to the Sky Deck platform and at the last minute decided to see whether there was availability at the bar. Tower 1 info desk was heaving, so we walked further inside the hotel ground floor which is indeed impressive and found the Towet 2 lifts. We ascended to the 55th floor and then had to swap lifts for the final 2 floors and wow what a view. We came up by the infinity pool and whilst that was only available to residents the adjacent bar was open to everyone and they had sufficient tables to allow us to walk in without reservations. Initially they said we could only have the table for an hour. Actually, we spent a very pleasant couple of hours having fabulous cocktails. Not crazy expensive considering the location. Our waitress was lovely and so was her manager, who both were very attentive and gave us some free tester cocktails. If we had only had one cocktail it would have been very similar to the entry cost of the sky deck. Once the sun had set we walked across the bridge on the ground floor/1st floor to the Sky Gardens another wow from the ground. They have a shuttle bus for a couple of Bart that takes you around the Sky gardens. Very handy if you’ve walked too much. Should have got the train to China town but got a taxi outside the shopping mall over the road not realising that the taxi rank was so chaotic. Dinner at a busy Chinese restaurant full of locals was as good as we hoped it would be. The dried chicken with chilli is worth trying. The tables are quite close together and we ended up talking to one of the tables and trying each others dishes.",January 2023,13,5.0
Awesome! Must experience in Singapore,"ROOMS: very spacious and so bright, there is a nice balcony in every room. View on Gardens by the bay is excellent! But another side is also wonderful - you can see fountain show from your room. Every room os equipped with mini bar (water, soda) and fridge, bathrobes and slippersLOCATION: you have direct access to the hotel’s lobby from the metro station, good location for walking around the Bay, 5min walking distance to Gardens by the BayFACILITIES: iconic infinity pool and sky deck, gym. There are plenty of restaurants, shops and services (ATM, grooming and etc), big deli grocery store and even casinoSTAFF: so polite and friendly. When we were waiting for check-in, staff member provided us small bottles of water",January 2023,955,5.0
Well worth staying here!!,"We stayed here the first two nights of our trip and so glad we did.  Our room was excellent 1315 - lots of storage, spacious, great balcony overlooking the gardens and clean.  The bed wasn't as firm as we like but it was doable for a couple of nights.  Access to infinity pool is well worth it and nice for relaxing/swimming/photos.  Spago for breakfast is amazing, lots of choice with great service.  Renko lounge is perfect for drinks before or after dinner as well as Lavo but the hostesses at Lavo are not that accommodating even when you have a reservation.  Go to the bar instead if there is room.  Ce La Vie was closed due to rain but even though it wasn't raining, it was closed with no explanation - Lavo is much better with the same views and much more welcoming.  We will stay here again.  Thank you for a great stay here.",December 2022,224,5.0
Disappointing - lacks focus on the customer experience,"What a disappointment….my wife and I looked forward to returning to Singapore to stay at MBS for our wedding anniversary…..should have gone somewhere classier, like the Mandarin Oriental!The floor we were in (46th Tower 3) smelt of heavily chlorinated water….but was not near the Spa or Pool; our room smelt of god knows what, but it hit you as soon as you walked in; the bed was rock hard and there were NO soft furnishings in the room…harsh and beige is the only way to describe it. To cap it all, the day before we left, we contacted “Guest Services” to ask if we could access the pool after check out as we had a late-night flight that evening to be told that we could ONLY use the pool before check out - but after, we could not. Really poor customer focus. This place could do with an exercise in “secret shopper” to stay and use facilities without staff knowing that a report will go to top management (if they care?). They have the patter….”Oh, we are so sorry…..” etc, but our experience was a poor one - I’d recommend going to a hotel that doesn’t rely on style over substance!",November 2022,8,1.0
Worth Every Penny for a Night Stay,This hotel is so iconic of Singapore. I know it costs a bit on the high side but it is worth every penny. The staff are super attentive and helpful and always go the extra mile. The views are absolutely gorgeous and breath taking. The pool is on a whole other level and you can spend hours there just snapping photos. I would 10 out of 10 recommend this hotel to others even considering the price as it is well worth the stay.,November 2022,112,5.0
Iconic,Iconic hotel. The pool is amazing and something you must experience even just once. Service is amazing and exactly how you would expect a 5 star hotel to be. The adjacent centre with all the shoppes is nice with high end shops and a great food court.,November 2022,15,5.0
"Marina Bay Sands, Sets Standards!💯","Immaculate hotel, Staff are amazing, the seamless integration of a mall, the easy access to Subway station, the Cafe’s in the Lobby, the quick check in & Check out.

Deserves a 6th star,"My wife and I went to celebrate our Anniversary. We were a little unsure when booking as it was noticeably more expensive than other 5 star hotels. Writing this after the stay all I can say is that we loved the hotel, and that it was completely worth it. Customer service went above and beyond all stay. Extremely helpful. Very generous. The location, perfect. Walking distance to the light show, the gardens, etc. The infinity pool... magic. My only complaint is that we didn't stay for an extra day.",November 2022,6,5.0
"Great reputation, average room",The general areas are great as advertised but the room is mediocre to its price. The only selling point is the access to the rooftop pool. The room amenities are comparably to those hotel at the fraction of the price.  Don't waste your money here,October 2022,89,3.0
Chaos - nothing worked!,"Came to my room # 2005 and the lights did not work. Problems with the key card. Electrician showed up 2 times to fix it. Than, I tried to set the air-conditioner off. You can have it low, but not set it off.Than I tried to make a note with your pen. It broke apart in two pieces. By now, it was 21:15 and I had missed the light show.Absolutely crazy.",November 2022,20,3.0
My happy place,"We returned after covid to our favourite hotel,  it is just the most spectacular placeWe love it here.  Your luggage is collected on arrival and delivered to your room.  Check in was a little slow but they were very busy.  The rooms are enormous,  our first night was in 4862 which was an upgrade to club it had a stand alone bathtub which we didn’t have time to use, and the garden view is mesmerising in front of you.  There is now a nightly light show there.  The second night we were in room 1721 I had requested a lower floor as these have much larger balconies.  The infinity is selfie heaven for photos and reserved only for hotel guests.  The bar area was not very accommodating in our opinion,  we were told they wanted the table back in an hr which could put people of, however we stayed around 2 hrs.  Under the hotel there is a shopping centre, food court some very good restaurants we ate at the French bistro we were a walk in but it’s better to make a reservation as there so busy.  There is also the MRT.  We had breakfast in the lobby which was probably the most choice I’ve ever seen. We would love to return to this hotel yes it’s expensive but worth every penny.",November 2022,34,5.0
The excellence in service !!!,We would love to appreciate this hotel for our anniversary stay!! We are from U.K and stayed for 3 nights! I have never expected such beauty and well prepared surprise done by John from Ambassador team!! He was the finest and charming hotelier whom I've ever met !!! I would love to visit this hotel again and hope to see him again for our future stay! Thank you so much once again :),January 2023,1,5.0
Thank you Andrè!,"We spent an unforgettable night here.Thanks to Andrè, working at the reception, who welcomed us with a warm smile and who took care that we get the best he could give us, this experience will always stay in our hearts and minds.We’ve been very lucky!",January 2023,1,5.0
Excellent service but average rooms,"We stayed at the Sands for a couple of nights on our recent visit because we wanted to cross it off the bucket list. The service and check in was excellent, we received our room hours before the official check in time. However, our room was on a lower floor and the noise from the freeway beside the hotel was horrendous. For the price it’s simply not worth it.",January 2023,3,3.0
Unforgettable MBS!,"My husband and I spent our anniversary at MBS for one night whilst visiting Singapore. Our room was Harbour View on 40th floor with amazing views of harbour and Gardens by the Bay (we got to see the light show from above!). Room was a good size and bathroom great. TV was enormous! Highlights:- extra care and detail for our anniversary was beautiful - cake, wine, flowers. Thank you Rosie :)- rooftop pool is AMAZING - we went at about 6pm and stayed for sunset, then again in the morning. Both times we got lounge chairs easily. I have never experienced anything like this pool. Definitely worth the $$$ for us. - LAVO for dinner (Tower 1) was great. Recommend booking early and ordering the peanut butter chocolate layer cake (can get it to take away)- breakfast at Spago was good - normal buffet, but with a beautiful viewHonestly a fantastic experience for us.",January 2023,10,5.0
Pricey but worthwhile stay in a global landmark,"I stayed here in room 4011 (a king bed with a garden view) in Tower 3 for two nights in January 2023.Rating: 8/10Positives:• The view and balcony from the 40th floor over the Marina Bay gardens was eye-watering• Bathing in the infinity pool on the top floor was a once-in-a-lifetime experience (although the water was a bit chilly)• The service was excellent although the personality of the hotel seemed to be lost amidst all of the other shops, restaurants, and amenities that shared the facility• The gym at the top of Tower 2 was outstanding and allowed me to work out facing 50th+ floor views over downtown Singapore• I didn't visit the casino but it was incredibly convenient to be connected to a mall with wonderful shopping and dining options• The hotel featured a novel express check-out systemNegatives:• The Marina Bay Sands is a bit of a trek from some of the other activities of Singapore, such as Orchard Road, albeit a trek that is still doable or easily arranged via taxi or public transport• The bed was a bit hard• The room itself was clean and modern but nothing extraordinary and was perhaps just starting to show its age• The rooftop bar on the top of Tower 3 seemed poorly managed – in what appeared close to full occupancy it took 20+ minutes between ordering a drink at the bar and having it served and paid for (I wanted to walk around and enjoy the view drink-in-hand)",January 2023,20,4.0
Stunning and busy,"We had a good visit here - just the restaurants, but it was impressive with a fabulous vibe.  Really so cool and great photo ops!  Must do the top and we had cocktails in Spago - panaramic views and so amazing to see across the city - even into Malaysia on a clear day",December 2022,42,5.0
Best staycation ever,MBS is truly amazing. Really very thankful to Joanne and her team from Premium Services for making the trip so magical and memorable.

"Expensive, but what an experience","Wow! Huge hotel that really hits the senses when you first arrive. We had a room overlooking the Gardens by the bay on the 20th floor. Room was superb. Totally blown away when we opened the door and the curtains parted to an awesome view. Even the TV welcomed us. Rest of the hotel was superb with a visit to the famous swimming pool on the roof and a cheeky cocktail as the sun went down ( very very busy, but still awesome) to the little shops in the concourse on the ground floor, and even getting down towards the MRT where there is even a replica of a Viennese canal complete with barges.Staff were superb from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, considering they were very busy with hundreds of customers and visitors. For us, it was only one night, and a bit of an expensive splurge on our trip, but we had to do it just to say we did.",October 2022,370,5.0
Stay Here at Least Once,"Marina Bay Sands (which everyone in Singapore calls MBS) is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  Certainly one of the most iconic hotels in the world.  The major claim to fame are its three towers capped by a rooftop infinity pool, restaurant and hot tubs.  The inside reminded us of Las Vegas premiere lobbies without all the slot machines and noise.   The breakfast buffet was really more of a brunch spread with just about everything you could think of.  Certainly one of the best I have ever seen. The room was pretty nice and we arranged for three guests which included a rollaway. Since a fourth family member was joining us for the last night of our stay, we needed a second room.  But in reality, there was a chaise lounge which could have easily accommodated our fourth…but second room was already paid for.  Would have been nice for hotel to allow.  Can’t say enough about front desk service.  In addition to allowing us to check in early after a 30 hour trip, the most amazing part was they remembered us BY NAME when we checked out five days later.  And we’re really not that memorable. The nearby casino can be reached via underground mall.  The negative is you need to bring your passport to enter and stand in queues to get it scanned. My understanding is they are ok for foreigners to gamble, but make it hard/expensive for Singaporeans to do so. To sum it up - stay here at least once.  It will be a highlight of any Southeast Asia trip.",December 2022,97,5.0
Best hotel in Singapore,"The best hotel in Singapore !! We loved everything about it (especially the rooftop pool). Definitely worth it.

Small details made it perfect,"Once in a lifetime experience. At first we weren't sure if the high price tag would be worth it but we got upgraded to a suite and it was 100% worth it. The view, room and pool were stunning but the small details took it over the top. For example, the room came with a Dyson hair dryer including a diffuser attachment - as a curly haired girl, this really impressed me. We had two small children and really appreciated the extra space too.",December 2022,3,5.0
Go for the pool!,The infinity pool is worth the price of admission. This place is great if you’ve been to Singapore and don’t need to run out and do touristy things. Stay here to purely stay in the hotel the whole time. There is enough to do and the pool offers great views.,January 2022,401,5.0

Processed rather than looked after.,"The main attraction is the pool, which does have amazing views.  But as others have said on here, that’s about it.  It is so big you are processed rather than looked after.  It’s very expensive but others hotels have got customer service way way better.  I’m pleased I stayed there for the experience but when we return to Singapore we’ll go somewhere that hasn’t forgotten how to look after it’s guests.",December 2022,17,3.0
Great service and room,Staycation at Marina Bay Sands for my husband birthday.   We were so amazed to receive a bouquet of fruits a chocolate cake and a tray of chocolate with cutlery nicely  done and delivered to our room.

Shockingly bad,"Problem is this hotel is just so impersonal . Very expensive and cant deliver on service. The hotel basically cant cope at full capacity and deliver a quality personal experience. Great marketing when you get the customer to blame themselves for booking when the hotel is full and busy and getting them to admit its your fault for not booking when quieter. Try the in house app for room service. Unbelieveably clunky and hard to use. Then try ringing down and its worse......... I gave up and went to bed hungry.Overpriced and getting away with it because they can!!!!!!!!This is Butlins for millionaires (google it).In the interests of balance.........Great location and views.Rooms reasonably well appointed but youre at the top end on price and the experience isnt matched by the price. Too big, too impersonal.....Sorry and i know management and staff didnt get out of bed to do a bad days work. Quality is awarded by the customer not claimed by the provider, End of school report.....MUST TRY HARDER. Absolutely crammed full which means its popular and people love it. Try it you might love it. But too many things not right for me. Cant please all of the people and Im one of them.",December 2022,3,1.0
Incredible experience.,"Incredible experience. To be honest I booked it for the infinity pool, as a treat. The hotel is a high-end, luxury destination but that top floor pool area, with palm trees and chill-out DJ tracks on a weekend, is spectacular. The adjoining mall, together with fountain show in the bay, is breathtakingly good. Can’t fault any aspect of this hotel from start to finish. Loved it.",November 2022,122,5.0

Not what I expected,"Very disappointed with the experience at the infinity pool, I was looking forward to a really luxurious experience after paying a huge amount of money for the room. Obviously if you book with your partner you will not be expected to be with two cards all the time for pool access and this was not required the day before by the pool staff. Reception didn't Inform us about each of us must be with the card in order to access to the pool. We spent all day enjoying the pool. There was no waitress offering drinks, no one collecting rubbish. To get access to the restroom you must bring your card with you if not you get bad treatment from the staff asking you why you didn't bring the key card with you. Following day I got a really bad welcoming by Rima. She didn't let us get access to the pool because we only had 1 card. Her rudeness did not impress me and that is not what you expect at a luxurious hotel. She didn't even call Reception to confirm our name. I have to go all the way back to the 34 floor to pick up my card and back to see her again and not offer any apologies or at least a friendly welcoming. Call centre at the hotel fabulous, very friendly. Disappointed with the buffet breakfast Rise. The sofitel in the city  does it way better and cheaper and theor rooms are amazing. They dont even have cream for a black coffee, and wheb we asked theybsaid its milk or nothing. Very rude. If you want to pay nearly $1000 NZD for the pool and the amazing view. Then you definitely get that. As for the rest, not worth the money. Go to the sofitel in the city who do hospo so much better.",October 2022,259,3.0
One of the better hotels in singapore,"This is always one of the better hotels in singapore. Staff are friendly. Food choices are good. The staff are trained to be so polite and helpful. Good system for training themRestaurant choices are awesome. Bread street, Yardbird, imperial, Koma(beautiful). Parking is a hassle though. Difficult to get a lot. Easier to cab over",September 2022,3,4.0
A once in a lifetime experience.,"You have to stay here once in your life, how else  do you get to swim in probably the greatest infinity pool in the world.  The hotel is slick, check in however is not, be prepared to queue for a while.  The view from our bedroom on 48th floor, of the city, was amazing, breakfast in the Spago rooftop restaurant  was superb. Please be aware that the hotel is noisy.  As soon as you step out of your room canned music follows you everywhere and there are so many people. Finding somewhere to eat, without lengthy queuing is just about impossible so do plan ahead.  Overall, I am glad we stayed here but I doubt we will be back, in our 60's we are just too old for this hotel.",October 2022,9,4.0
Icon of Singapore,"Notably Singapore’s most iconic luxury hotel.  Many say that if you have not taken a picture of yourself at the Marina Bay Sands, you have not been to Singapore ! Guests will have entry to Observation Deck and guaranteed access to the Infinity Pool but during peak period, the infinity pool will be very crowded.  Non-hotel guests will need to pay for a fee to go up.to the observatory but not the pool. Located 56 storeys up, the SkyPark Observation Deck offers panoramic scenic views of Marina Bay and Singapore’s famous skyline. There is the Ce La Vi bar that serves nice cocktails & drinks but getting a seat with unblocked views requires reservation. The best time to go is before sunset so that you can enjoy both day & night view over a couple of drinks. However, if you want to see the Marina Bay Sands building as part of the skyline, I recommend that you go to another tall building  eg. CapitaSpring’s 51st floor.   It is just like you shouldn’t go to the Empire State Building if you want to see it as part of the Manhattan skyline. Besides the roof top, there is the Sands Expo & Convention Centre and high end shopping mall linked to the hotel.",October 2022,978,5.0
Choose tower 2 for smart hotel experience.,"Spent some days at Tower 1, in a room facing the Gardens by the Bay. Then back in Tower 2 for another couple of days in a room facing the Singapore River. Both were awesome. Tower 2 is a renovated and smart hotel with bedside lights switching on automatically when u wake up at night, and smart toilet that stop all manual flushing or lifting up of lids. Service staff is impeccable and friendly.",October 2022,149,5.0
Incredible stay for the start of our honeymoon,We cose the Marina Bay Sands as our first stop of our two week honeymoon. All I can say is that the experience was second to none. A very smooth and fast  check-in.A small issue with our travel agent which somehow thought it was a good ideea to start our honeymoon in a room with two single beds was dealt with in a very professional manner by the nice ladies at the check-in desk. We received a very nice room upgrade with both a city view and a garden view.Breakfast has so many options for all tastes and cuisines.Dinner at Spago (57th floor) was amazing.Infinity pool at the 57th floor is a 5 star experience . We are not people who like to gamble but the Casino experience is a must.Could not think of a better place to start our honeymoon.,October 2022,4,5.0
Fantastic views and loved the room. Infinity pool takes the win!,Firstly I have stayed here a few times. The architecture is superb. We had a lovely gentleman check us in to our hotel. Bell boys were friendly and super fast with bringing our luggage up. The gym is 5 star and has everything you need. The infinity pool is prob the best swimming pool I have ever swam in. It is my go to hotel in Singapore. Husband and I enjoyed our night here stopping over before our flight to greece. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone just wanting to experience once in a lifetime!,October 2022,79,5.0
Amazing hotel with outstanding staff!,"We were a group of 13 (7 of those being children), traveling with 3 separate reservations.  During check-in, Jenah was very accommodating!  We wanted to have our rooms on the same floor if possible.  She worked tirelessly to make this happen.  She escorted us to the Lounge to wait while she worked through this process.  Once our UPGRADED room was ready, she personally showed us to our floor, explaining everything about the hotel along the way.  She went above and beyond.  It was a memorable experience. Our stay at the Marina Bay Sands was fantastic and we will definitely be back!!",October 2022,1,5.0

Amazing stay in an iconic hotel,Architectural magnificence. Amazing hotel with superb facilities with a rooftop infinity pool. Staff very happy and helpful. Rooms are spacious and well furnished. Towels and robes provided for the pool. No pre-reservation was necessary due to the time of the year we visited which was a bonus for us. Reception staff were amazing and arranged our room by midday which gave us chance to enjoy our one night stay. The views from the infinity pool was breathtaking with once in a lifetime experience.,October 2022,40,5.0
"Iconic, a must if the pennies permit but its impersonal","Staying here is an event in itself. The roof top pool is fabulous. If the budget allows its a must. However, it's sheer size makes a stay somewhat impersonal. It's like leaving your bedroom and walking into a mall. Saying that it is well placed, views excellent, transport links are ideal and never to be forgotten accommodation.",October 2022,53,4.0
Amazing Hotel,"We stayed for 4 nights for my 60th Birthday, and it was everything we wanted. Please bear with me as it is quite a long review. We originally booked for 3 nights in a city view orchid suite, but Singapore airlines changed our flight to the day earlier, so we booked an extra night in a deluxe room. Before arrival we got an e-mail asking if we wanted a complimentary transfer from the airport, we of course said yes please. So, when we arrived, we were meet by the driver and escorted to a luxury vehicle for transfer.  Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by a representative and escorted to my room for check in, we had been upgraded to a deluxe room with a city view. The room was great and in itself would have perfectly fitted our needs, the view was spectacular, but we were only in it for one night.  The next day we transferred to the orchid suite, and this was beyond what we expected, the room was massive. You walked in and there was a sitting room with tv and dining table with drinks and snacks all included with the room, the view was of the gardens by the bay great. You then walked through and on the left was a big walk-in wardrobe with safe and plenty of hanging space, on the right was the bathroom the bath was again large it had double sinks a big walk-in shower and a toilet.You then walked into the bedroom, well I say bedroom, but it also had a sitting area           another tv a big comfortable bed a massive room. The room was fantastic but is expensive I would say it is well worth it.More about the hotel now, the rooftop pool is obviously the big draw and is one of kind and something you just have to do, we did day and night swims, and both were great the drinks are good, and you just have a great time, be prepared it does get busy.  The room also came with access to the club 55 lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and later on drinks and canapes all were of top quality and the view is brilliant.  If you want to book a restaurant, which it has a lot in the hotel and in the shopping centre across the road, do it before you arrive maybe by a couple of weeks, as they were all booked up and we couldn't get in. The location is great in the bay and with the MRT in shopping centre, getting around is easy the shops in centre are all designer and are very expensive.The only negative was on check out; we had a late flight to Perth so we thought we would be able to stay to use the Sands lounge for a couple of hours and maybe have a cup of tea and relax, but no we had to sit on some hard seats in the busy check in area, it just seemed that once they had your money they didn't care, a bit of shame. I will wrap it up as I have gone on a bit.All in all, a top-class hotel with great service I will use again if I go back to Singapore.",August 2022,174,5.0
Lives up to the reputation,"I was very fortunate as I booked MBS at a time when prices were lower than they are today. There was not as much tourism in Singapore then as there is now. Of course it was still fairly expensive but i Think it was worth it, at least for me. Now when you are staying at MBS of course the best part is the pool. The rooms are fine, I actually got an upgrade from a lower floor to a slightly higher floor facing the gardens by the bay, but presumably you could get a better room and a better view at a different hotel for the same price. But the pool is truly unique. You don't even have to be swimming in the pool to experience the view, and of course take lots of pictures, overlooking the SG downtown skyline. At present there are still not as many tourists as before the pandemic, so the pool was not super crowded. And i was lucky that when I was there it stopped raining after raining more or less continuously for a week. Though, at night there was some lightning and so there were times when you could not swim in the pool during the lightning warning. One more thing also is that the rooms facing the gardens, at least the lower ones, are near a busy road, so it can be somewhat noisy in the morning. But this is a minor issue given that there are few hotels around the world that can offer an infinity pool like MBS does, especially on a clear day when you can see all the way into Malaysia. The other facilities, like the gym, are also not bad, but the pool is the reason you would stay there, and this is what makes MBS unique.",October 2022,5,5.0

The pool is nice but hotel room and service is not that good as 5 stars hotel,"You can go there for casino and infinity pool, other then this it's not attractive at all. The infinity pool is nice but you will not going there everyday, because it's too many people and not easy to get seat and clear picture. The renovation of hotel room is old, I can't understand why they can refurbish it. And the worst is they have renovation work during midnight. I can clearly hear someone drilling the wall at 2am. I called the reception and they told me doesn't know where is having night work and can't stop them. I can't believe this is happening in 5 stars hotel and I was paying SGP$600 to sleep at the working site lol I got the video with me and clearly can hear the drilling works, I was try to show to their manager and I forgot to do that, if you want to go pls think about it.",October 2022,55,2.0

1st visit to Singapore,"Our 1st impression of Singapore outside of the airport was the staff at Marina Bay Sands resort. I can not say enough nice things about the people of this resort.

Everyone was so helpful and truly wanting to make our stay exceptional.  They succeeded. This resort is fantastic.

Marina Bay Sands Orchid Suite Stay,The service provided by MBS was anttentive and had enjoyed my 3 days and 2 night stay at the Orchid Suite at 54th floor at Tower 3. The view from ge suite was breathtaking. The chocolate cake that they prepared by premium service for my so. was delicious. The service staff were friendly and the amenities were replenished daily. The highlight of the stay was definitely the infinity pool and the management at the pool was attentive too. There was a free temporary tattoo art service crafted for all ages at the pool. I believe that this is a holiday event organised by MBS. Would visit again because of the infinity pool and the places attraction around the vicinity.,December 2022,2,5.0

Service Falls below expectations,Came for a staycation for a family event. Check in queue was long and service was not up to expectations.

He recognise me and had such genuine smile and welcomed my friends and I with such joy! Not just the greetings, he performed such high level of service that never fails to impress me. Never forget that he is still as thoughtful as he is in my previous encounter and pass my friends kid colouring book. It is such attention to little details that truly define “Customer Service”.

A bit long queue for check in counter at tower 1&2. Email instructed to check in at tower 1 but was told our room category is located at tower 3. Have to walk over to the other end for our check in. Good to offer at city view even though at lower floor as requested.

Obviously a major highlight is the infinity pool on the roof - stunning! It has always been on the bucket list for years now and I’m so glad it didn’t disappoint. Would definitely go again!",November 2022,21,5.0
"The most amazing hotel, staff and service","Originally booked a couple of nights for my partner Jayne’s 50th birthday for May 2022 however postponed due to restrictions still in place and stayed 5th -7th December 2022. As it was a special occasion booked the orchid suite and wow!!! MBS arranged to pick us up and take us to the hotel where we were immediately met by a representative who took us straight up to our room and checked us in there. Bottle of champagne, cake and flowers were in situ for Jayne which was really well received. The room was huge and all amenities were great. The club 55 was superb, staff so polite and helpful and overall the hotel, staff and service could not be improved upon. Limousine arranged complimentary to take us to our next accommodation and it was fantastic.We will be back again for hopefully another memorable visit. Thank you MBS and all staff.",December 2022,7,5.0
I am still dreaming about my time there,Wowsa. We stayed in a Sands Premier Room for 2 nights in Tower 2 with a magnificent view of the marina. These newly renovated rooms are luxurious and spacious with beautiful touches like the cocktail trolley. The infinity rooftop pool is just ridiculous. Definitely worth the splurge (for both MBS and the newly renovated rooms). Cannot wait to return.,December 2022,19,5.0
WOW!,This place is unreal the room was huge the TV was the huge the view was amazing as was the pool on the roof the service was impeccable the sauna and steam room were amazing the bathroom was perfect along with Roberto Cavalli toiletries the complimentary mini bar was a good touch and the overall vibe was amazing this is worth the money to stay here oh and the beds were incredible,November 2022,"1,636",5.0
"Fantastic wedding, Bridal room & service",We decided to hold our wedding banquet with MBS and it was a blast of an event with the crew organizing most of the things for us to allow us to take our mind off and focus on other issues. Bridal suite was provide to us super clean & couldnt ask for a better service team which allow us for a comfortable and fuss free experience to rest after the event. Thank you Rachel from the event team for organizing all these and giving her best to assist with our event. Also huge thank you to Mark who made sure our stay at the room was a memorable one and we super look forward to coming back again very soon.,January 2023,1,5.0
"Disappointed, won't be back.","We had 5 nights, we had moved from another hotel just for the highlight of the NYE 2023 Fireworks, which didn't disappoint. Nice room, lovely view of gardens and the Bay, no bath, mirrors fogged up when showering, service hit and miss for an expensive hotel.  We had one in room dining experience, the menu choice was extremely poor, and the food was below average.  We had one breakfast at Rise, but otherwise dined outside the hotel. Security was really excellent, making sure visitors couldn't access guest floors. We have stayed in Casino Hotels before, but this one had no atmosphere or feeling, it was all a bit lost.",December 2022,13,3.0

An incredible experience,"I had visualized the hotel long before I went to it in November 2022 for my 70th birthday, but the actual experience was fantastic. The infinity pool, the restaurants, the shops, the room and amenities were brilliant, but what made it unique was the personalized service. I had informed the hotel I was coming with friends and the management did everything to make the event very special, from being greeted at the airport and then in the lobby, to checking in being done in the room and the champagne and cakes waiting for me. An incredible experience for eight days. I could not have asked for anything better. Thank you Marina Bay Sands.",November 2022,1,5.0
Disappointed,We visited Singapore to celebrate Christmas.  We had stayed in MBS in 2015 and the experience was very good. So we decided to go there again. Unfortunately it was a bad decision. The hotel was overbooked and understaffed. An order of a cup of warm milk or a cup of chamomile tea took minimum 45 mins to 1 hr and many a times the kids went to bed without drinking that milk. The restaurants were perpetually booked for the entire day and so was the spa. For breakfast there was a huge queue and the waiting took away your appetite. The waitresses were overburdened and never remembered the orders that were placed with them. The hotel seemed to be biting more than it could chew. There give entry to random people in the lobby who come in only for selfies and gave the hotel the look of an overcrowded fish market. The infinity pool was the worst. The water was highly chlorinated and the snacks served there deserve zero stars. Roadside eateries serve better food.MBS please upgrade your standard and increase your staff otherwise there is no dearth of good hotels in Singapore,December 2022,21,1.0
30 Dec 22,"We dined at Rise, Marina Bay Sands. We were attended to by Ms. Seow Geok from start to finish. She is attentive, courteous and professional. What a gem!The buffet spread is huge and worth every dollar! We will be back in the future.",December 2022,122,5.0
Singapore Short Vacay,"The hotel location is ideal, near to MRT station, convenience store and various restaurants nearby. The hotel is clean and tidy. If you come with car, it has free parking as well. The staffs are friendly, definitely the service is good. Would recommend everyone to stay over.",December 2022,0,5.0
Avoid at all costs,"We moved from Ritz Carlton to Marina Bay Sands as kids wanted to experience the pool. What a big mistake! The rooms were half the size of what we had at the Ritz and we were paying more here. The service was terrible. We were told we would get a call or text when rooms are ready to checkin which we never got. So ended up waiting 2 hours just to check in. The restaurants were all fully booked for the entire duration of our stay. The place was so packed, like a shopping centre before Christmas. The only place for breakfast had queues so long that we ended up waiting 30 to 45 mins every morning just to be seated. We attended a Liverpool Crystal Palace match whilst we stayed there There were over many guests from the hotel who attended the match. When we got back  (10 pm) we made a room service request for dinner and after 1 hour called them to chase. To be told there is another hour's wait. That meant waiting in excess of 2.5 hours for room service. We ended up cancelling it. The only saving grace is the pool. The staff and service there is great. But we could have had that without staying there. All other staff were arrogant and had an attitude. We would never stay there again. They allow non-residents to enter and the problem is there are people just walking around taking selfies. Even while having breakfast or lunch, and we found it so annoying. Not a good experience.",July 2022,42,1.0
Amazing hotel but very impersonal,"Large international hotel, corporate and expensive However loved the infinity pool and all the entertainment in the locality - free light show, gardens etc Our room was very well appointed and comfortable, fantastic balcony overlooking the gardens Shopping centre very high end but the food court was fun and there’s a Starbucks if needed !",December 2022,81,5.0

Incredible pool/view but area very commercial & expensive,"You must go to experience the most amazing pool & view . The pool/jacuzzi are clean and safe ; the views from the room and pool are incredible . I would however , only recommend one night here and stay in Sentosa if you have a family . It’s very commercial and all about the shops at the marina and incredibly expensive . English breakfast by the way impossible unless happy to pay ALOTWe were given chocolates in the room ; drinks by the pool which made for a lovely tough by the hotel - you also get free ice cream The resturants on the roof look amazing with great music vibes but it was confusing whether we could take our son in or not so didn’t eat there. It’s perfect for the gardens by the bay and fountain show which I recommend . Taxi access extremely easy and good way to get around . Mini bar with soft drinks in room free which is a nice touch Overall a real experience and a must do but think 1 maybe 2 nights enough for us",November 2022,270,4.0
BEST hotel in Singapore!,"Had the best stay!!! Booked the newly renovated Sands Premiere Room. Way better than the other room types (deluxe and premiere) we have stayed in before. Highly recommended! Worth the upgrade - very premium and executive feel, well thought of design and kudos to MBS team for doing the room renos. I need not to say more about the location and pool. This is the best in SG!",November 2022,1,5.0
Loved my stay!!,"Had the most fun, relaxing and homey vacation here last September 24-25!! All staff are commendable and might I add very approachable and knowledgable!! Because of the vastness of the hotel, it’s not hard to get lost but AHHHH staff are all very accommodating and even with the language barrier, they would push their limits just to help!! I loved every second of my stay here. Just to add, I really had an amazing stay and dine in experience at lavo with the help of Sir Dennis in the pool area. He went above and beyond call of duty just to answer and help me with all my queries. Plus, he’s a great conversation starter. I really loved how he made us feel special as if we’ve known each other for so long. I love it so much!! Would def go back here because of the superb service!

A hotel with the best facilities and services,"I stayed at the hotel for the entire four-day trip with two children on my first visit to Singapore.The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is locationally perfect and has the best views and services by traveling to the country.The cleanliness and room service of the accommodation were also excellent, and breakfast was also diverse and delicious.With this trip, I learned why I think of the hotel when I think of Singapore.Each of the hotel staff was very kind,In particular, I would like to express my gratitude to Mark, a hotel employee who responded with kindness from the arrival of the trip to the end.Thank you for making this unforgettable trip:)If I visit Singapore again, I will definitely stay at Marina Bay Sands Hotel again.",October 2022,0,5.0

Amazing hotel,"My family of 4 stayed at the beautiful MBS for 7 nights - our first overseas trip since the pandemic.  We had two connecting deluxe rooms, king room for the adults and a twin room for the teens.  We had uninterrupted views of the Gardens by the Bay in our balconies - spent a lot of time out there!  The fridge and mini bar were well stocked with complimentary water, soft drinks, juices, chips and nuts (replenished daily).  The beds and pillows were so soft and comfortable and we slept so well everyday.  The bathrooms were spacious with tub and generous toiletries.  Infinity pool is a once in a lifetime experience - we made sure to swim at least once during our stay in the morning, afternoon and evening so we could appreciate the lighting and experience the atmosphere and vibe each time of the day.   Walk along either end of the pool to see great views of Singapore - truly breathtaking!  The hotel is HUGE however everyone we encountered from the front office/concierge/bellhop staff to the housekeeping staff have been nothing short of lovely.  MBS is connected to the shoppes downstairs (for high end shopping) but for those who want to hit other areas, its a quick underground walk to the MRT station (get a metro card - just tap in and out, way easier! Can be purchased at any metro station -just head to the ticket window to buy and you can top it up at any MRT machine later on if required.)  We went to Sentosa, Chinatown, Orchard Road even all the way the suburbs to go to the waterpark with no issues at all.  One of the easiest metro systems we've been on and the trains come every few minutes (City Mapper app is your friend!)  We've been to Singapore a few times before but this trip was particularly memorable, no doubt hugely thanks to a beautiful stay at MBS!",July 2022,45,5.0
Most famous hotel but worth it?,5 star hotel. is it though? or is it 5 star just cus where it is. we had the city view  while the room wasnt luxurious (hence the 4 stars) the view was. Room service food was ok. expensive and not worth it. Plenty of food elsewhere way cheaper.We got free access to the skydeck and the pool. its also connected to a huge luxurious shopping mall and the marina and the gardens by the bay which is worth the visit. there were so many people checking in and out that it doesnt give you warm feel like any other luxury hotel from the staff. its kind of like a circus. if i could only stat at 1 luxury hotel it would be the ritz carlton across the bay,October 2022,284,4.0
The marina bay experience,"We stayed in MBS for two nights while visiting Singapore for the first time.Very impressive place with a slick operation to keep it all running. We arrive early and we’re given temporary cards to allow us access for the pool and amenities which was really good and we did end up having our room early which is always a plus.  The staff member who checked us in was very thorough and really helpful. We had a garden view room and it was the best choice for views and the rooms were a big size with a gigantic tv which is always a plus. The casino is a vibe! Felt like vegas minus the bar as they didn’t seem to have one there. Pool was an amazing experience both in the day and the night. Views at nights are fantastic. The Ce La Vi bar is well done and always busy. We didn’t reserve but decided to pop in for a drink to enjoy the views and were happy to stand as we didn’t reserve. However, the staff were pretty rude and almost made us feel very unwelcome and unwanted which was not the best for us starting our night off. Take this situation / scenario away - this would 100% be a five star review.",October 2022,34,4.0

Amazing bucket list experience,"We stayed at the marina bay sands as a young couple for 1 night before we start our budget backpacking trip. The pool is sensational and well worth the stay if the weather is dry. We were a little disappointed that the pool had to be closed due to lightning warnings but understand that this is out of staff’s control. The room was also very nice, clean and luxurious. Jerry from reception checked us in early and was very professional and polite, as were all the staff we dealt with. We were also given complimentary cake for a birthday which was great. The only thing we felt was missing was breakfast not being included in the price. Overall it was a fabulous stay and would recommend to anyone that can afford this luxury.",November 2022,7,5.0
Birthday celebration,"Spent an awesome birthday weekend at MBS.My staycation started off being whisked away in their first-class service MPV to the hotel. Check-in was a breeze at reception and being escorted to the room by the Premium Service team made me feel very welcome. Their immaculate service to walk me thru my suite to ensure my needs and requests are satisfied.😘Delightful surprises of champagne  cake and canapés were sent to the room too!The room is clean and huge with spectacular 360° view, especially of the vibrant cityview at night.

Renovated rooms are amazing,"I stayed at MBS pre-pandemic and was rather disappointed with the guest rooms, they were extremely basic, more 3 Star than 5 Star, not worth the money. Heading back to Singapore I stayed in one of their renovated rooms and I was truly amazed by the transformation. The renovated rooms are top luxury, lots of accessories, a mini bar out of this world, they can finally compete with the best of the best.",October 2022,"2,030",5.0
"once in a lifetime, amazing customer service","This has been on our bucket list for a while. We treated ourselves to a night mainly to experience the pool. On arrival we were told we had been upgraded to two suites but in different towers. We explained we needed to be near our teenage children and then the amazing Sheila somehow gave us the upgrade of a lifetime to a 2 bed suite on the 54th floor. We were beyond thrilled and she was so lovely and excited for us! The room was breathtaking and the view incredible. Everything that you hear about the pool is true, it is unlike anything I've ever seen before and worth every penny. Unfortunately the water was cold following a huge storm but that's because we chose to swim late at night when it was quiet. Breakfast was vast with every option you could ever imagine eating and more. If I'm honest I'd say it was more quantity than quality and although we were welcomed by the maitre d' who was lovely and very friendly the waiting staff didn't come to us once so I don't think we even managed a cup of coffee. Still we could have pushed. Everything at this hotel is on a vast scale but it's absolutely worth going to see and experience. Even the gin trolley and pudding buffet in the evening were worthy of note, there's just so much to try!",October 2022,27,5.0
Nice hotel with excellent Customer Service. We will be back.,"I have been staying few 5* hotel before and this is the best customer service hotel l met. I booked a suit room for my son birthday. To my surprise, the hotel called me one day before and told me that they can arrange a complimentary pickup from my home to MBS. Although l didn't need pick up from my home, but they allowed me to use it from MBS to my home during checkout. The check in process was smooth & the room was big, clean with beautiful view. Hotel even gave my son a complimentary nice dark chocolate cake.  I would like to thanks the hotel staff, Mark Delegero, Alan & the staff who sent us back to home. With their professional services, We really enjoyed our stay and don't feel like going out of the room. We would like to thanks Mark Dlegero, he is very professional and knowledgeable, he knew that we are 1st time staying in MBS, he extend his service to show us arround, accompanied us to our room, brief us what is provided in the room, where we can enjoyed our breakfast next day and he even bring us to club 55, swimming pool etc. Of course we will be back in our next staycation.",October 2022,1,5.0
Fantastic in every aspect!,"As most people know, this place is expensive, but it is worth its money. The atmosphere is fantastic, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Great care is taken over even the smallest items and that makes all the difference. Plenty of places to eat, a large shopping centre with all major luxury brands attached and of course the infinity pool on the rooftop are just out of this world. You can stay in this Hotel for a few days without ever leaving it once [as we did this time]. We are already planning our next stay.",November 2022,443,5.0

2017 Late Review-  found my handbag and couriered to Sydney . Superb.,"I’ve been meaning to write this review for 6 years, and always tell friends and family what a fantastic experience I had. The main reason for my review was because of how proactive and helpful the staff were. I left my handbag in a taxi on the way to the airport. It was just a standard unbooked taxi. I was distraught and tried everything to find the taxi when at the airport. The hotel checked the cctv, time, asked what I was wearing and managed to find the driver. The handbag was then couriered over (at my cost) to Sydney where I was staying. Absolutely first class service!",February 2023,40,5.0

Vegas experience in Singapore,"Very beautiful hotel in Singapore with some of the same pros and cons of a large Las Vegas hotel/casino.    Beautiful Disneyland like property but terribly slow service at bars and restaurants.   Slow as in sometimes an hour or more just to have a server visit for the first time after initial seating!Room:  Clean with a nice view.   We stayed in 5010 overlooking the Gardens by the Bay.   Perfect air con and clean room with free bottled water replaced daily.   Solid and attentive housekeepingService:   We didn’t require much non-dining service.   Pre-arrival emails were very promptly responded to.   Check in was really slow, but friendly.   They can definitely improve the check in process to make it faster, but this was a very minor inconvenience.   Bellmen were awesome.   Gym:   Beautiful and busy, as to be expected for such a large hotel.    Plentiful equipment of all types.   One of the most well equipped gyms I have seen at a hotel.   Friendly staff and an amazing view.    Great weight selections with dumbbells up to 80 pounds and unlimited barbell plates.   Dining:   So many great options.   All were very good from food and drink perspective.   But the service is incredibly slow at the rooftop restaurants Ce La Vi and Spago.   Way understaffed.   Up to an hour or more just to place an order on some occasions (once we waited 80 minutes and then walked to the bar to order drinks ourselves because we had not yet seen a server!!!).   Be prepared for long waits to receive any service.    Might be ok if you want to spend 5 hours on your meal.    Views on rooftop restaurants are amazing though so that helps.   But it can be really hot and humid so long waits at the outdoor restaurants and bars can become uncomfortable after awhile.   Pool:   Beautiful views but crowded and no shade/umbrellas/cabanas.   Can get really hot.   WiFi:  Free and perfect, no issues.Overall:   Excellent location and beautiful views.   Some items that can be improved upon on the service side, but it was a great experience overall and I would not hesitate to stay here again and work myself around the slow service issues by perhaps dining elsewhere or being more proactive and vocal about service right at the time of initial seating.",September 2022,246,4.0
"Excellent staff, infinity pool is amazing","Thanks to Singapore Airlines rebooking our flight, we ended up with a night in Singapore and decided to splurge and try the Marina Bay Sands. This with the famous infinity pool has been on my bucket list, and as we were celebrating our anniversary it seemed perfect.From arrival to departure the staff were on the whole excellent. The receptionist on check-in was very accommodating of our late flight the next day, and gave us a later checkout. As the booked room type wasn't available, we were upgraded to a suite on the top floor!The bags were delivered to the room - or should I say suite! It was quite impressive with two balconies, two massive TVs, a huge spacious bathroom with bathtub. The bed turned out to be extremely comfortable. Other nice touches were the included minibar containing juices and soft drinks, and that the staff came up with a cake denoting our anniversary - thank you! There were a few minor negatives with the room, the first being the smell of stale smoke. It was stated that this was a non-smoking room, but people have clearly smoked in there. While the room and surfaces felt clean, there was some black mold on the ceiling of the shower that I would not have expected from a hotel of this class.The infinity pool (Skydeck) area is awesome. Plenty of sun loungers and towels, along with good staff. Didn't try any of the restaurants on this level, but did make the ""mistake"" of going down to the observation deck a few floors down. Don't do this - the view is not much different from what you get on the top floor, and you are surrounded by tourists. I found the changing facilities and toilets on the level below to be a little meh with no proper place to change and not super clean (again, in comparison to the rest of the hotel)Overall a very enjoyable stay, although everything in MBS is expensive.",February 2023,450,5.0
Memorable experience.,"A birthday’s treat to stay two nights in this iconic hotel.  All the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, especially Grace who arranged a few special treats for my birthday, I was very grateful. Fabulous view from floor 35 of the gardens and all the ships at anchor. We were glad that we walked into the gardens on the first night to see the light show as it was better from underneath, and it rained the following night.My only niggle is that the children have a large area of pool, in fact the whole of the infinity pool I believe, and there is only one small area of sun chairs and jacuzzi’s designated adult only.   This was not watched over by staff so we frequently had young kids in the jacuzzi and running around and screaming which spoilt the experience.",February 2023,108,4.0
Superstar treatment for an ordinary family,"Thanks to Mark and his team to make our family trip to Marina Bay Sands truly pleasant and light-hearted. We were caught by surprise right at the door step of the hotel when Mark and his team meet us at the hotel entrance and supervised us directly to our rooms, making our first time in room check-in experience memorial and careless as we did not have to queue up in the lobby, tired and restless after a long flight with the infant in our hands, but instead were supervised directly to the room, where we could directly take a relax. A big kudos to the hotel team to have such service, especially very helpful for big families after long flight. Just that experience made me feel like the room charge per night was totally worth the price. After a quick and easy in room check-in, we realised that we forgot the baby stroller in the airport. We were offered a free limousine service by the hotel to go and come back to the airport to pick up the lost baby stroller. I was even escorted by the driver in the airport to find the lost item, which made the search fast and easy.While I was in the airport picking up a lost baby stroller, my wife and her family went up to the roof top for a place to eat, since we were very hungry after the flight. However, the restaurants upstairs were fully booked and the only option was to go outside of the hotel for a lunch. Then I sent WhatsApp message to Mark and his team asking if they could arrange for us a table, and to our surprise they found one table for us. This type of treatment made us feel like we are the special guests of the hotel, but we were just an ordinary family staying for few nights in the Delux rooms. The team was always online available to answer all our questions, arranging bookings for us and etc. Eventually the experience we had with the hotel service makes us want to come back to this hotel, and I can definitely tell, that because of Mark and his team we are going to come back for our next trip to Singapore to this place, just to feel a little bit special.In this hotel, thanks to Mark and his team, you do get treated personally and respectfully. Me and my family we are very thankful to Mark and his team to make our trip to Singapore memorial and hassle free.Will surely recommend this place to my friends and family when going to Singapore. This hotel is a must stay to experience this private hospitality.Dmitrii & his family with love.",February 2023,8,5.0
Prepare to be wowed,"Amazing from the moment we were greeted out of the shuttle. Greeted by name and taken to priority booking room as we had booked with amex. We were personally shown to our room with fab views of the city. Lots of personal touches and extras such as macrons and models. Lovely view of light show from our room. My hubby shut my daughters fingers in a car door and the staff had a medical team there within 20 seconds. Couldn’t fault any of the service especially as they were servicing up to 6000 people at a time. Only down side was that as we travelled as a family, it is t really as suited as a family friendly destination, more slightly older. There were food options but had just been better at other places. Still that’s not their main focus and we appreciate that. Also to be mentioned is how close it is to everything especially gardens by the bay. Def worth a visit.",January 2023,86,5.0
Still in awe from the amazing experience (Thanks NICOLE!!),"Travelled to visit Marina Bay Sands from the United States on Dec 28th, 2022.On December 22nd, 2022, I contacted Marina Bay Sands hoping to plan surprise proposal to my girlfriend on the Sky Observatory deck. No other piece of modern architecture is more iconic than MBS in Southeast Asia and I had my eyes set.In just the few days before the Christmas holiday, Nicole was offered to connect with my 3rd party photographer and help coordinate the proposal as if I asked my best friend one favor in my lifetime. She is an amazing human and I can tell why MBS is lucky to have her be the face of their iconic brand.Nicole granted permission for my photographer to be at the Sky Observatory Deck for the special moment when I popped the question. She even kept in communication with my photographer on a 2 hour photoshoot to surprise us with a generous gift with chilled champagne and truffle chocolates in our room when we returned. The property itself is fantastic - from the intimate infinity pools, to the world-class architecture in the casino, to the immense amount of beautiful shops in the mall. Oh, and we cannot forget the delicious food at the food courts.The experience at the property was far superior than the hundreds (yes hundreds) of times that I've visited in Las Vegas. But, it was truly the delicately care that Nicole selflessly provided that truly meant more than anything.",December 2022,0,5.0

Excellent,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for three nights.This hotel was excellent and as we loved the pool. However, out of all the hotels I have stayed at, I would like to say a special Thank You to Marina Bay Sands. On our holiday (we went to a few places), my 10 year old  son became ill and became dehydrated.    By the time we reached Marina Bay Sands, it was becoming obvious that he was not well.  I contacted the front desk and the staff organised an ambulance and a doctor to come to examine him.  Marina Bay Sands security helped take my son in a wheelchair to the ambulance and assisted us with our passports and details we would need to take to the hospital.  The  staff at Marina Bay Sands simply went above and beyond.  My son went onto make  a very speedy recovery after going to A&E at the hospital.Yes - I thought the room we had was excellent.  The hotel was wonderful and such a good location.  Above all though I would like to say a heartfelt thanks to the staff who really did care about us in our hour of need. I would like to say heartfelt  thank you for making us feel so special and taking care of my son while we visited Singapore.Thank you.",September 2022,8,5.0
A Hotel that is heaven for Adults but not great for families/kids.,"We arrived in Singapore as a family. Beforehand, we arrived to 2 different hotels that were cheap and reliable. When we first arrived to Marina Bay Sands, we were stupefied to see how many adults were in the hotel. At that time, it was school holidays in most parts of the world. The check-in time was at 4:00pm as well. When we first arrived to our room, it was pretty standard for a $1000 SD per night hotel. Nevertheless, the facilities were superior for adults. Consequently, Marina Bay Sands is a great hotel for adults ONLY.",October 2022,1,3.0
Surprisingly personal service at this huge hotel,"It's an enormous, sprawling hotel, and the check-in experience was similar to checking-in at an airport - not ideal.However, it was clear after a few encounters with the staff that despite the fact that we were 4 people of thousands of people passing through,  that this hotel was special.Each interaction with the superb staff felt personal and the staff were fully invested in us having a great time.I'd single out the following staff for exceptional service:Concierge (and Clef D'Or holder) -  Muzaffar - he went the extra mile to help us book our night safariPool-side manager - Maurice (one of the nicest Aussie's I've met)Pool life guard - Mo ( a one in a million character)",July 2022,8,5.0
Singapore’s best,We had such a lovely time in MBS! The service is outstanding and the facilities are simply amazing. Singapore’s best hotel totally did not disappoint. Plus points that we were given a generous upgrade from Garden view to City view.,August 2022,6,5.0
Vegas at Singapore,This was my 2nd time at MBS. I had a great stay. I would like to say that this time I experienced an even better service. The room service was very prompt. The waiting time for breakfast was much less. Also the breakfast selection was very nice.The staff was very helpful as I had arrived early and the check-in executive gave me a temporary card to access the pool and the health club so I could relax and shower by the time my room was being readied up.The views from the hotel is undoubtedly amazing.,September 2022,276,5.0
Different to all the Rest,"This hotel deserves 5 stars for its sheer size. Our visit was to the MBS was the most impersonal experience I have ever had at any hotel anywhere in the world. When you arrive you are simply one of thousands of other guest who are checking in and out of the hotel that day. The surprising thing is everything does seem to be well managed which is why the place deserves five stars. It is another thing I have ticked off the bucket list, but as for returning, that wont be happening.",September 2022,56,5.0
Breathtaking hotel with friendly staff,"We had a wonderful stay at MBS. The staff were friendly and helpful and of course the rooms, the pool, the views are AMAZING!

Disneyland on heat !,"If you are looking for luxurious personal service, this hotel is not for you.The swimming pool view is the highlight but it's not for swimming, it is for posing and taking pictures.We hadn't booked anything because we didn't know we had to and we didn't find a restaurant to eat in before 9pm because everything is fully booked.There doesn't seem to be anyone to help you navigate the madness of so many people so even though as a hotel guest spending a lot of money it doesn't feel like you are important to the hotel.The guest room is a wonderful sanctuary. We had a high view across the gardens and bay which was wonderful but this was not enough to make me want to go back.",September 2022,22,3.0

Impeccable service,"The service was impeccable.  The staff are so welcoming and always on their feet.

Memorable Experience,"We booked this stay to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. This was also the first time traveling with our 1 year old son to Asia. After a long 19hr direct flight from NYC, we were tired and didn't have any expectations. As soon as we arrived, we were blown away with the service and the kindness of the staff. We arrived early at 8am but our room wasn't ready yet, so they suggested we visit the gardens and they will text us when the room is ready. At 11AM, we got the text and check-in was smooth and quick. The room was clean, and everyday we had our fridge and water stocked. One thing I do want to compliment is the hotel keeping their policy of the infinity pool is for guest only. This was a major reason why we booked all 6 nights at the hotel and with the price we paid for our stay, we definitely appreciate them enforcing this policy. We noticed a few individuals trying to take advantage of their infinity pool. I've overheard guest who are asking for ""extra"" room cards in the lobby because they ""lost"" theirs or individuals trying to intimidate their way in by saying they ""left"" their cards in the room and shouldn't have to go back and get it etc. This was one of our favorite hotels that we've stayed at and everyone at the hotel made it a memorable experience for us.",September 2022,112,5.0
An amazing place,"I stayed at your hotel a long time ago, but the room on the 50th floor with a view of the bay was amazing. The rooftop pool of the hotel left an unforgettable impression.You have a friendy and polite staff.",November 2022,1,5.0
"Great hotel, service, and location!","We were nervous on whether we should stay here or another hotel in Singapore. People had told us that it was a big like Las Vegas or Disneyland - and let me tell you - it was better! First of all, you can't beat the location. It's perfect in every way - just Google it! The Concierge team was excellent - they helped us with anything we wanted to do at any time. They gave us ideas, and even met us during breakfast to walk us through ideas of how to spend our days. The large and best mall is connected to the hotel, and the MRT (Subway) is just downstairs from the hotel. They have great restaurants in the hotel and in the connected mall - and an amazing food court/hawker stands! You can see the light show in the fountain and the Supertree Grove. We stayed in Tower 2 - which is the newly renovated tower. THE POOL was LOVELY! This was also a highlight - and it's only for guests. When the weather was nice - we would take a break and just hang out at the pool. The sunsets are beautiful.  You can get food and drinks at the pool also. We also had drinks on the rooftop and that was really nice as well - and something I would also recommend.  OVERALL - the answer is YES! Stay here if you are visiting Singapore! We have to go back through Singapore to catch our flight back to US - and we can't imagine staying anywhere else for our last night in Singapore!",February 2023,15,5.0
Enjoyable staycation,"We stayed at MBS Tower One level 43 from 15 to 17 February 2023 and the view was beautiful. Although there was some minor unpleasantness during check-in, the experience was quickly rectified by one MR LEE from the hotel’s operation team. We were impressed by the swift action taken by MR LEE to resolve the issue we experienced upon checking in, which was in less than an hour after our feedback via email. This incident reflected how MBS prioritizes guests’ feedbacks and is making every efforts to make right what went wrong.",February 2023,90,5.0
Best Hotel & Service ever experienced!,"The best stay and experience at a hotel ww have ever had. We are a family of 4 with kids age 13 and 11 and got one of the newly renovated premium 2 bed suites. (Room 1990). Wow, just an incredible room, the children had their own double beds, we had a cinema room with karaoke, the views, the beds, the butler service who were so attentive and kind (Jacob, rasul and Raien) and the attention to detail was just too class. We have stayed in other  luxury 5/6 star hotels around the globe, this has to be our favourite. An absolute must visit, you will not be disappointed. Thank you to Paul, Wange and the incredible MBS butler team for the most wonderful stay and special memory.",February 2023,19,5.0
One of a kind,"This place is certainly unique and huge.  Having said that it was no problem to get sun lounges at the infinity pool.  The pool is the the big draw card and a bucket list experience, which we thoroughly enjoyed.  Pool service was good but we’ve had better cocktails elsewhere.  All the staff were impeccably polite and helpful.  My partner was given a complimentary mocktail and some chocolates for a birthday surprise, which was a lovely gesture.  We had a deluxe garden view room on level 29 in Tower 3.  This tower was not currently having renovations so all was quiet.  The room itself is ok, nothing flash, the bathroom is nice.  Origin & Bloom has the best coffee we had in our 9 day trip and the ladies there are lovely.  The only thing to question is whether it’s value for money.  We paid more here for a basic room than we did for suites at both The Intercontinental and Swissotel the Stamford.  As it was a special occasion we splashed out and did it.  Would we go again?  If we won lotto and could afford a suite.",February 2023,107,4.0
Loved it and highly recommend,"Absolutely amazing! I loved the level of service provided in the entire hotel. At the infinity pool, Moe (lifeguard), was exceptional. He was very professional, attentive, had sense of urgency, and knows how to make a customer feel welcomed.

Amazing Stay,"Checked into MBS 2 weeks ago with my husband and little one. While waiting for my check in, i approached a guy with black suits enquiry about the hotel facilities. Daniel from Premium Services attended to me and we have a quick conversation but in detailed. He even flash out a pokemon card from his suits pocket as a small treat to my son when knowing his birthday is coming soon.I was amazed with the little gesture from him and being patience for my enquiries even he was waiting for his VIP guest. Thank you Daniel! Look forward to stay in MBS again!",January 2023,2,5.0
Exceeded expectations,"We booked the Deluxe Garden View room but we were very kindly upgraded to a newly refurbished suite in the second tower. This room blew every other hotel suit out of the water. The suite came with spacious rooms, very modern technology and insane views from both the bedroom and living room. Staff were very friendly and attentive. Only thing I would say I wasn’t to keen on would be the breakfast buffet, considering it is very dear, but this could just be down to personal preference.",September 2022,30,4.0
Best night ever,"We stayed in the Orchard Suite city view on the 45th floor, the team at MBS helped organise a surprise proposal for my partner.

2 night stay,"Me and my partner stayed here at the start of our 5 week travel. The hotel was amazing and facilities excellent. The food was superb and portions of a decent size although expensive. The hotel was so clean, beds really comfortable and lovely smell throughout.

Would definitely return!",September 2022,11,5.0
Perfect night away,"We stayed here as a couple on a Saturday night for my partners 40th Birthday. We stayed on the 52nd floor which had amazing views of the Marina and Singapore skyline.The infinity pool on the roof had breathtaking views and we went here several times during our short stay. During the daytime we were kept topped up with free ice creams and ordered cocktails from the bar menu. The jacuzzi was the perfect way to end the evening.The room itself was very spacious with a walk in shower, a very large bed, 2 giant TVs and a lounge area.We had a meal in the evening at the Spago dining room. The food was delicious and well presented. To have a meal and drinks with the view across Gardens by the Bay was very special and well worth it.There are so many hotel options in Singapore, but we are glad we stayed here and will have fond memories of our trip.",August 2022,24,5.0
Incredible Structure and Location,"We stayed at MBS at the beginning and at the end of our SE Asia trip. The beginning was fabulous as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and also had an upgrade to the MBS ""Prestige"" Rewards Program, so we were upgraded to a fabulous suite, with a view of both the bay and gardens. They also delivered a cute little cake. We had signed up for the Re-Imagine promo and received a free voucher for each night of stay for either breakfast, lunch, rooftop lounge, science museum, or infinity pool photos. The Rise Restaurant was excellent with an amazing array of choices. MBS is an incredible structure, with the best location. We walked to the Gardens by the Bay twice. Of course, the infinity pool and Observation deck are a must do as well. The MBS Rewards program gives cash back for hotel stays and purchases. That works well if you plan to come back to Singapore before a year is up. Since we did return to Singapore and MBS at the end of our trip, we used the reward cash from the first stay. However, we cannot use the reward cash from this last visit since they give you the rewards after check out. MBS should allow online purchases using rewards.Our second stay at MBS was a bit disappointing, as they did not upgrade us even though we are return customers, still celebrating our anniversary, and I had the Prestige Reward card (which includes an upgrade), but the booking was under my husband's name, who didn't have the ""Prestige card"".  They could have easily changed the booking to my name, but refused. They did give us a cute little cake again. Overall, one must stay at MBS at least once to experience this amazing place.",September 2022,492,5.0
Appalling customer service.,I was on a trip to Bali and decided to stop over at Singapore for two nights which I booked via their website. I booked a superior room which was on the highest level as I wished to experience the beautiful views across the city and Of course the infinity pool. However when I arrived after my long flight I started to encounter issues. I was only allowed to book one night as there was an issue with my card. So I stayed the one night. I was told to check and book again in the morning for the second night. Which I did but my card got declined. So I then had to leave the hotel to stay at the airport. I then find out a few days later that my card has been charged for the second night. This hotel would not allow me to stay the second night and happily escorted me out but then charge a full nights stay to my card. Absolutely disgusting. At present I am asking for a refund back and they won’t answer my calls. I am a solo traveller and never been in another country on my own before and no help or direction was provided to me.,September 2022,53,1.0
Unique experience,"We were receiving invitations to Marina Bay Sands for the last 7 years or more. Last summer we decided to visit Singapore and, stay in this hotel. All Bay, View, rooms were already booked, so we took Garden View room on the opposite, side of the tower No 3. This turned out to be the best choice. All rooms with Bay view have no opening windows nor the balconies, however the Garden View rooms are having this, advantage. You can slide yoyr glass open and, enjoy the view from your balcony including evening concerts  in the gardens with illumination of the artificial forest. All services were perfect. Laundry exceptionally good. Rooftop swimming pool Cristal clean and staff serving free drinks. Dining at, Rise restaurant opulent and very well served. The only thing I can not recommend is a rooftop bistro restaurant with an artificial queue and uncomfortable coffe tables..In general, great time as long as you are not shy of the crowds, at the reception and Shopees mall.",September 2022,26,5.0
Perfection!,"What can I say but PERFECTION in every way!Everything was just perfect, the room, decor, cleanliness (spotless), customer service, food…ooo, and let’s not forget the infinity pool, amazing!From the moment I walked in after 16hr flight from London, till the moment I check out, I can not fault anything. Thank you so much for making my first Singapore visit so memorable and such a pleasant experience! I will definitely come back! Highly recommended!",September 2022,11,5.0
THE HOTEL IS MORE INTRESTED IN QAUNTITY RATHER THAN THE QUALITY,"The rooms were not ready - and this was at 4.30 pm,, 90 minutes past check in time, it was very busy, and looks so much like, the hotel is more interested in quantity rather than the quality or the guest.  The room was dirty, with large staining on the bed, which we had to ask to be changed - no dressing gowns or slippers.  We had young adults with us - who asked at the pool area, about the music venue, on this floor (of which we could have booked, but was told the night club might suit them better), so didnt book, when they went to the nightclub, it was shut - they went back to floor 57 (i think it was 57), to be told oh sorry - yes i gave you thee wrong info - but then wouldn't let them as it was full, and they didnt book - although advised not to. I brought this to the attention of the check out clerk - whos english was very very poor - in the end it became very embarrassing, with a que of people. the cost the hotel charges, is ridiculous for the standard we had - Yes it has a lovely infinity pool - but there are far better hotels in singapore to use.",September 2022,4,1.0

"Absolutely amazing, expensive but amazing","This hotel has been on my bucket list since watching a documentary  pre covid-19.It didn't disappoint and yes it is very expensive but for a 'Once in a lifetime' experience it's worth it.We had a city view deluxe room on the 46th floor and it was very special, the views over the fountains and city were mesmerising, could spend hours in there watching the world go by.The thing that makes this extra special is the infinity Pool on the 57th floor, WOW 👌 We visited every morning and evening for sunrise and sunset. As well as the infinity Pool there are hot tubs, loungers, couples seating and a couple of restaurants. Food and drink is also available, but be aware it is very expensive and you need to allow for taxes and 10% service charge go be added.We were given a complimentary upgrade. Room has very large and comfortable bed, sofa, table and chairs and a non alcoholic mini bar which is complementary.We could have stayed In the hotel and associated complex for our entire stay, 4 nightsVariety of places to eat ( and shop) from cheap food court to very expensive high class restaurants.Staff were top class, nothing too much trouble and so attentive and friendly.",November 2022,289,5.0
Delightful service provided by the Premium Services team especially by Mr Nicholas Len.,"Was supposed to have a delightful and fuss free check in for the suite room but was not informed beforehand so went the usual route. However, the front desk informed Premium Services and Nicholas came by and quickly assisted my wife and family in the check-in which was greatly appreciated since there were elderly and kids in tow. Hotel stay at MBS was already delightful from my past experiences and continued to be delightful in this trip but my first suite stay brought my expectation to new heights with the amenities of the suite, the wonderful service of the Club 55 staff and not forgetting Nicholas who went all out to made this stay an unforgettable experience with professionalism, thoughtful surprises after understanding the purpose of our trip, and even a nice gesture when we were checking out. Overall, the experience of the suite and Nicholas' delightful service completely wow-ed my family and I will definitely be back again. Highly recommended if fuss free and delightful experience is what one is looking for.Facilities-wise, the view from the room, the legendary infinity pool, and the gym continue to be excellent. There were daily kids activities which were good to keep the young energetic ones happy. Advice: plan and book the F&B outlets that you will want to go for the trip earlier to prevent disappointment.",November 2022,1,5.0

A big disappointment,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for one night  in November 2022 it was something We always wanted to do,  but was so disappointedWe booked and paid for a triple room as we were 3 adults   At check in we were told that another bed would be allocated to the room and that would be taken care of On inspecting the room the toilet area was dirty   There were stains on the carpet   Could see no quality control   Had taken place on the room.   We went out of the hotel to enjoy Singapore when we returned  to the room  in the evening no extra bed had been put in  the room      2 of us had to share one bed which was not a comfortable nights sleep. breakfast was a real let down   I think the hotel is just a show piece with no substance just over hyped       And over priced for what we got                                                                                   On our trip we stayed in 5 other hotels and were  all 5 star and they were so much better all the rooms accommodated 3 adults   And clean                                                                             we stayed at the Four Seasons in Singapore on our trip  room fantastic food lovely and far cheaper should not have wasted our money at MBS",November 2022,13,2.0
A hotel with excellent facilities but disappointing services,"My friend and I were staying for 3 nights in this hotel to attend an activity nearby. At first we were fascinated by how modern and grand everything in this hotel looked, but its services later turned out to be a real nightmare.The first night started with a disturbing sound from 2:30am for every 5-minute interval arising by the pressure from the pipe system. After 15-20 minutes we could not stand with the noise and decided to call for a check. A technician then came to our room, inspected and asked if we want a room change we should call the front desk on our own, so we explained everything to the reception, but we were offered a downgrade without any compensation or had to wait until the morning for their management team to get back to work. We turned down this unacceptable offer and asked them to reply as soon as possible BUT NOT UNTIL THE MORNING. Half an hour later we were given a same grade of room, with card keys delivered to our new room and our stay extended to 2pm on our last day. Why would such a 5-star hotel have no 24-hour management for emergency situations?On the next day we were pleasantly surprised they delivered some great truffle chocolates and a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused. However on the last day, after we finished relaxing at the fascinating infinity pool on the top floor at 12pm, our card keys stopped working, and after lining up at the lobby with our swimwear to find out what happened, we figured out the card keys worked until 12pm but not 2 as promised. The reception lady named Adele claimed we should approach them for an extension. How in the world the customers will understand THE WAY YOUR SYSTEM WORKS?????? Why are not the card keys being delivered to our room???? Or a note saying our cards should be replaced????By the time we checked in, we were told that the amounts we spent in Marina Bay Sands hotel mall could be accumulated as points, which can be used to reduce our room price when we check out. However by the checkout time, the same lady Adele decided to settle the payment as quick as she could without even bother asking whether we had any points available. It was not until we raised out how our points could be utilized, she then realized we had points to use. She even urged us to spend more on the hotel shops before even trying to void the invoice so that, we believe, she did not bear any responsibility for her mistakes. However we of course refused and eventually got our points deducted from the room price by her manager with the previous settlement voided.We had to say the facilities in the hotels are awesome, including the gym, sauna, steam bath, restaurants, and especially the infinity pool. The rooms are flawlessly clean. However we were very disappointed with this terrible experience happening in a 5-star hotel as an icon of Singapore. The services seriously need great improvement.",November 2022,45,2.0

Wow!,"Having had 3 nights at the Paradox at Clark Quay we had a final night at MBS . It was our anniversary a few days before and so emailed the hotel to enquire if anything special could be done . This hotel and the staff go over and beyond what is expected . Not only did they email back to advise they would provide a desert and try and accommodate a higher floor but when we checked in the lady on reception also gave us 50 S dollars to use whilst in Hotel . Floor 10 in Tower 3 was a great view over Bay  gardens . A delicious desert awaited us . Water and fruit juice complimentary. The room was fab . Great 5 star . Large TV , comfortable bed , large shower and great toiletries. Fortunately the sun shone so up to the iconic pool which didn’t disappoint and was on my bucket list . Wow !! I loved this hotel . Not for everyone. Lots of designer shops  and a casino . Watched the light show , sky observations deck great for views . Staff so friendly and organised . Probably won’t return as there are so many other places in the world I need to see but Singapore was great .",January 2023,875,5.0
Better to look at than stay in.,"We stayed for 2 nights in January, immediately after Luna new year, so the hotel was fully booked. The hotel is luxurious but with over 2,500 full rooms, it was very crowded. The service was efficient but impersonal. Our room was on the 48th floor, very well appointed with a fantastic view of Singapore however, it stank of stale cigarette smoke. Every time you entered the room, you would be hit with the foul stale smell. Our teenage son had to sleep on a pull out sofa bed (not that that is an issue) which was extremely uncomfortable and you could feel the springs in the mattress. You would expect better from a 5 star hotel for additional sleeping requirements.The fitness centre is very well equipped, has a great view and includes sauna & steam rooms. The famous rooftop infinity pool was spectacular but the days we were there it was raining and windy so we only used it to take a few photos.  The location is really good and the adjoining shopping mall, casino, theatre, food courts are only a short walk away. The choice of high quality food/eating options within the hotel is very impressive. We had the Luna buffet and was impressed with the range and quality of food available. Good quality seafood including lobsters, Alaskan crab, scallops and much more was in abundance. Overall the stay was nice but the room smell and lack of personalised service detracted from the experience.",January 2023,11,3.0
An amazing experience,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and had such an incredible experience. The hotel is stunning, so much thought has gone into designing it.But the element that made this hotel truly wonderful was the staff.

The location is great. Everything is at arm's length (shopping center, restaurants, casino, Chinatown, etc). Hassle free check-in and out. We were allowed to use the pool longer than our check-out time. The only disadvantage I could say is that the in-house restaurants (especially by the pool) have long waiting time. But maybe because it was popular and the food was delicious",January 2023,3,5.0
One of the best and my favourite hotel in Singapore to stay.,"Always a pleasure to stay at this hotel, and this is I think the 10th or 11th time I've stayed at this MBS hotel and it's always been a pleasure.  The rooms are huge, bay view, city view, garden bay view, whatever you fancy.  Marina Bay Sands Hotel is one of the best luxury hotels in Singapore which is just a few steps away from the best Shopping Mall, Casino, Spa, Gym and many restaurants and valet service. It is perfect for a staycation, business trip or vacation to stay over.  I would like to recommend this hotel to anyone in this world who wants to experience hotel services that exist in this hotel and its surroundings. -ARAJETSET-",January 2023,16,5.0
Wonderful stay at Marina Bay Sands,"From the moment we arrived till the drop off at the airport on our departure everyone was genuinely so friendly and helpful and went above and beyond which made us feel really special. The level of service was of the highest standard and we truly felt welcomed and appreciated as guests of the hotel. We  cannot recommend the Marina Bay Sands enough and thoroughly look forward to the next time we get a chance to travel to Singapore and stay there again.Thank you and the rest of the Premier Services team and all of the other staff at the Marina Bay Sands.Kind regards,Kelly Pedersen",January 2023,2,5.0

Poorly trained employees and weak management,"Check in line was 20 minutes. Concierge was extremely rude. On line Restaurant Menu does not reflect actual menu at Cedeles, Rise Restaurant explained that 1000 Island Dressing is the same as Shrimp Cocktail Sauce. I don't know if they were too lazy to get it or they ran out. Mashed potatoes is a no show.",January 2023,40,1.0

5 star for the masses,"Pure class, but a very big hotel and this can take a little of the shine off it.  Only issue was housekeeping forgot to put towels in the room. I found out the hard way.  And it's expensive, real expensive.  But in saying this I'd definitely stay here again. It's a walk to the gardens and a quick. Taxi down town.Cabs were hard to find so suggest getting a SIM card and using online rideshare.Also pay for a city view.",December 2022,270,4.0
"Pristine designer shops, service exceptional to the Sky Platform just incredible",No visit is complete with out a visit to Marina Gardens. The hotel is stare of the art. No you do not need to stay there. The shopping mall is incredible. Eat at the food hall lots of cheap choices if in a budget. The Skypsrk is incredible. Wait till 8pm and watch the fountain show Spectre it's free and awesome.,December 2022,87,5.0
Wonderful experience at MBS Hotel,"Hi Team, I would like to show my upmost appreciation to Mr Andre, from Premium Service Team. I have wanted to compliment Andre’s professional service but have not been able to find the right channel to do so. First of all, I would like to show my appreciation to Mr  Andre for making our stay at MBS being so memorable and special for us. I do understand that we have made a request of extending our suite stay at the eleventh hour and thus we are not expecting too much from MBS. However, Mr Andre managed to bring us a very pleasant surprise of extending the suite stay for us, and what makes it so special is that we will be staying in the same suite. This has brought us huge convenience as we have a young toddler with us, and changing suite room means that we will need to spend the hassle to pack and unpack, not being able to enjoy the stay. Mr Andre has, of cos anticipated this while doing the planning for us. In addition, he also brought a sweet surprise to our toddler with a bunny. We can't thank him enough for this sweet gesture. As mentioned, having such wonderful experience stay at MBS is also all thanks to the Premium service team for extending a $150 dining credits to us. Therefore, we have decided to have another stay in the coming year as we know that MBS is always fully booked till the end of the year! At the moment, we are touching base with Mr Andre on this, understanding rates and hopefully, we can have promotion or early bird discount. I look forward to return back to MBS hotel for another wonderful stay with my family in soonest time.",December 2022,4,5.0
Brilliant,"My wife and I stayed here for a week. With the exception that some refurbishments may be required, everything was excellent from the moment we checked-in, until we departed. Service was great and room was comfortableHotel is super convenient - as well as having restaurants and eateries within the hotel and lobby, it is connected to a large shopping mall (with numerous restaurants and a large food court.    Room includes a free minibar.  Although limited items included, its nevertheless a nice touch.    The highlights are the views from our room and the infinity pool on floor 57!",November 2022,125,5.0

More than 5 Stars,"Wow! This hotel blew my mind. I was hesitant to book here because I have Diamond/Gold status with Hilton, IHG Hotels, and Marriott. But my friend recommended it and I'm glad I stayed. This was a true 5-Star experience. I stayed at many 5-star hotels and this one is definitely more than 5-Stars.",December 2022,6,5.0
Impressive,"Impressive: views, service, friendly and helpful staff, facilities.Numerous restaurants on site or a short walk away, from fine dining to street food.The hotel has sustainable credentials and leads the way in the region, from food waste to the use of recycled plastic packaging  Good conference and event space linked to the hotel.  Good transportation linksThe hotel is being refurbished, but as a guest I hardly noticed.It certainly has the wow factor.",November 2022,1,5.0
Nice view but lack service,The rooms is adequate with great view but the hotel food service is lacking.  I stayed two nights at the hotel but had two terrible experiences at the top floor and Rise on the ground floor for breakfast.  The service level is not really live up to a 5 stars hotel.  They seems do not feel like to serve us.  The Rise staff even came to tell us half way into our breakfast buffet that they will charge $20 for juices even though the BUFFET is included in the room.  We ask for the manager for explanation but hear nothing. It was later on find out if you go ask for freshly squeezed juice then it will be charged.  If you go for the juice at the buffet table then it is free.  However the waitress made the mistake never came and apologize for the mistake.  Her attitude was not good neither is her English.  Other employee apologized to us for the mistake eventually after we complained but with two bad experience at two different restaurant make you winder...   My experience can be summarized as great view but service is inadequate.,December 2022,206,3.0
