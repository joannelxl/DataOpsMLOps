Not being part of the instagram community for me it was not worth the money.Very crowded (also due to Chinese New Year which dod not give me a nice relaxed break moment on this trip. Our room was nothing special in size nor in luxery. It was on the 7th gloor with a view at….. the walls of the shopping malls.Breakfast at the top floor near the iconic pool was expensive but amazing! Food at the pool was very over priced and portions to small.Once in a life time? Maybe for some mot for us!\n",

      "Review Text: MBS is well known but in my opinion overrated. The rooms are overpriced for the type of room you get. I work remotely and take my work with me when I travel. Most 5* hotels have a business center. When I asked the front desk one of the staff was confused as to what a business center was. Another staff then said their business center is in the convention center but it’s all booked. I have a feeling they don’t really know what a business center is and that they don’t have one. I don’t mind working from the room, but I prefer working from a business center or a lounge area. There is no convenient lounge area. This hotel doesn’t even have a real lobby to rest your legs. We were only here for a few days. We also tried their dinner buffet which was very good. Service was a bit slow though it is CNY and a busy time. When we were seated we were informed our champagne would be served right away. It was about after our second round of getting food that our champagne was actually served. Then when we paid the bill our server asked for us to stay at our dining table so they can double check our room number is correct. After waiting for 5-10 minutes the server never came back to let us know we can leave. We had to hunt down help to confirm it was okay to leave the dining area. The other area we accessed was the pool. The worker “Vicky” was checking in guests. I understand the pool is for guests only and you need to swipe a card per adult guest. I have three kids and they claimed my two teenagers ages 15 and 16 are adults. And they would “let me in this time” but next time to register them so they have their own hotel room card to access the pool. I’ve never heard of such a ridiculous requirement and shouldn’t this be something when we were checking in that the front desk advise us of? The hotel is conveniently located with lots of things to do. But I do not consider this place family friend or work travel friendly and likely will not be coming back.\n",

      "Review Text: The wonderful experience started with the lovely, short-haired, friendly woman who helped me check in at the front desk. (Maybe her name is Levie?) She is the nicest hotel employee I have ever met! I really appreciate it, thank you very much. In addition to impeccable cleaning, a pleasant smell that fills the room, and sufficient amenities, there are also ample hotel facilities. This is exactly the hotel stay we were looking for. I have never had such a wonderful experience. This is definitely the best hotel. It's worth visiting Singapore just to stay at this hotel. I will definitely stay again. it is really amazing! !\n",

      "Review Text: The CNY period is busy for everyone, but most luxury hotels find a way to manage.  Not true for Marina Bay Sands.  The check in experience has been appallingly bad.To not have any rooms available until 3 pm is understandable, albeit inconvenient - but to not have a single seating area available for guests to wait in is absolutely unconscionable.  There are ZERO chairs / couches anywhere on the first floor, they've decided to monetize by giving every last inch to the buffet.My elderly parents are traveling with us, and we had to walk around for 30 minutes looking for a place to sit.  We finally squeezed in a beach in the food court area in the mall to wait an hour for our rooms.I was then called, and specifically told ALL three rooms we booked were available (I made sure to ask).  We all walked back (again - a long distance) to be told, just kidding, only one of the three was currently available.  What should my elderly parents do in that case?Finally, even after we made it to the rooms - it was literally a 45 minute wait for our luggage to arrive.I have traveled extensively around the globe, and Marina Bay Sands ranks amongst the very bottom.  They have an iconic location, the views are nice, the service staff have been trained to smile and say nice things - but it is far, far from a luxurious experience.\n",

Food service was very rushed in Spago (despite there being other tables available, so there was no need to rush us out to turn our table over).  Lavo for dinner was so noisy and crowded we couldn't talk.  Wonderful place to stay - go somewhere else to dine.\n",

Glaiza's professionalism and warmth made us feel immediately welcome, while Mark's assistance throughout our stay added a personalized touch that truly set this experience apart.
