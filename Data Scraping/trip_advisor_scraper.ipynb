      "Review Text: We stayed here for 4 nights. We had no idea that the restaurants would be so busy and it would be so hard to book once we were here, so book ahead! We ate in both Lavo and Cest la vie and had good meals in both.. the prices are extortionate though for what you are eating. Cest la vie’s menu is pretty limited too. We had a drink afterward in their sky bar which was really nice with that great view. Breakfast the first day, what a queue! We had to wait half an hour.. one of their restaurants, Rise is being refurbished so one less restaurant for breakfast… (my advice come early) we skipped it the next day but had had it the last 2 days and the queues were better but we were earlier. Breakfast was ok, nothing special. The staff are all lovely, we didn’t encounter not one unhelpful or miserable member. The pool - well what can I say about that big pool with that great view, not bad waiter service and comfy loungers.. just lovely. People were out there until late at night relaxing and having food on the loungers. The room was spacious, great showers and plenty of products.. the bed was pretty hard though and sadly the complimentary fridge only had a few cans of sugary fizzy drinks.. we left a note for our housekeeper to swap them for sugar free drinks but no luck.. I tried again for our last day and bingo two coke zeros.. We thought we’d try the casino one evening and what a palava, passports, your Singapore entry form then their face recognition couldn’t match me to my passport .. any how we nearly have up as we are not gamblers, we just wanted to have a quick go at roulette. Any how we finally got in.. it was ok… similar to the Hippodrome in leciester square being leant on and pushed out the way so players could put their bets on.. It has a walk way to get to the Garden by the Bay which was very handy. We could also see the light shows, one from our room and one from the Cest la vie bar. The hotel is massive… shops, museum, theatre the lot. It’s spotless and seems really well run. We had a very pleasant 4 night stay.\n",

The roof top infinity pool should be heated, but its not and as many guests ventured in to get that must have photo, the look on their faces was priceless. At the prices they charge here the Marina Bay Sands should and could do better. It was an enjoyable few days but we left feeling somewhat disappointed.\n",

Unable to get anywhere to eat or drink in hotel or attached shopping complex unless you have booked  - even then we struggled to find anywhere two days ahead. Nowhere in hotel you can sit and just get a drink when raining - never had to book to get into a bar!So many people and not enough basic facilities Queues at 6am to check out tooDefinitely an experience but won’t be returning\n",

We like the infinity pool, but it is windy & cold for my 9yo daughter.  If you bring children there, be prepared to keep them warm.  Restaurants are always busy, it is best to make reservation up front.  We drove & the Valet parking service (daily rate with multiple entries) is very useful (because the carpark is quite a distance) & reasonably priced.  Easy to get staff assistance at Tower 1 lobby area & Tower 3 pick up / drop off points.  Staff are very friendly, helpful & well-trained. We were assigned a Premium Serivces agent during check-in & felt being taken care!\n",

The roof top pool is a must and it’s lovely to lay by the pool and take a dip and enjoy the view. The gym is small for the size of the hotel but it always had space when we visited. The buffet restaurant was good but nearly always busy. We were in a suite but unlike other similar hotels they didn’t have an executive lounge for snacks etc,shame!\n",

I raise my hand and waited for about half an hour but no one serve me even they saw. After that Guna came here and serve us. We ordered few times and we was far away from the counter to order. And he still patiently serve us even we have a lot request.  2nd day when we come. Still is him who serve us. Wanted to know how come no others ppl working while I sees most of them are just walking around without serving customer. Wanted to give him a very good thumb up. And service was really good.\n",
