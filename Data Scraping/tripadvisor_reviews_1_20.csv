ERICA, you went far and beyond any expectations, making our stay unforgettable. From the minute we arrived at the hotel you were already standing at the front with a big smile providing us with a great personalised service and checking us in straight into our suite.The constant assistance and communication that you provided every single day made us feel welcomed and made everything extremely easy.The day of our check out you came to our suite straight away with the assistance of luggage service, but also you arrived with an incredible and detailed gift with a message in a card that was handwritten by yourself about our wedding anniversary.You took us downstairs and immediately provided us with transport.But one thing we will never forget was that you remained there for us until our transport drove us away, and I remember looking at the review mirror and you were still standing there with the biggest smile making sure that was all taken care off.THANK YOU.",December 2023,1,5.0

Great Time,"It was my first time and I loved it, the swimming pool especially. I went there early in the morning when there were not a lot of people yet so I could do laps. The atmosphere was quiet but you can fill the energy with a bit of music in the air and crowds slowly filling the space. The weather was comfortable with the wind. The view of the Singapore skyline was great and unobstructed 360 degrees. It was a shame I was there just in the early morning to swim, and so I missed the chance to see what it is like other times of the day especially at sunset. I guess one reason to go back 😊 Special thanks to Alvin who checked me into the hotel (and upgraded my room 😊) - he gave a nice introduction about the hotel since it was my first time.",December 2023,16,5.0
Best and beautiful hotel,"We stayed in rooms 506 and 523 in Tower 3. Room 523 had best view of the park. Rooms were very neat. Rooftop swimming pool was amazing.  Train station in underneath the hotel which made transportation very easy. Enjoyed every minute of our stay in this hotel.If we can afford the prices, this is the best hotel",December 2023,4,5.0
The Wonderful Paiza Suite Experience,"I had an amazing stay at the Paiza suite #4569. The experience of the entire stay truly exceeded my expectations.Firstly, the start comes from the room. It was astonishingly huge in size. That is capable of hosting at least 12 guests. Very good for hosting a Christmas or New Year's party. The technology from this suite was insane. You can control from the ipad panel. The bathroom was amazing, too. The shower room had two shower heads. It really brings it up to the next level. Secondly, the amenities in the suite was top notch. It even had a water menu. It is truly unique and not only cater but also exceeded your needs. The bath jacuzzi experience was superb🤩Lastly, the butler service team, which sums up the whole luxury experience. Mr Suba, a Malaysian butler, was so humble and passionate about service. He was so detailed in everything he does. Be it the cleanliness of the suite and maintained the standard of the service. He is truly a 7 star butler. Amazing and kudos to him! I can foresee he can go far. Mr Paolo was amazing, too. He was patient and detailed as well. Even though how busy he gets, his smile will also be there. Thank you so muchJerry Chin",December 2023,1,5.0
A Compliment,The service is great. The assistant UmA and trainer Anant are very passiontate and friendly. The equipments are in good conditions. The gym is very big. Free drinks and fruits are provided. Toilets are in great conditions too.,December 2023,2,5.0
Just wow,"We stayed here almost a fortnight ago, and we already want to go back!It was so much fun right from the start. We were greeted on arrival by Patrick, who asked us where Charlie was. Charlie who? Charlie’s Angels of course, lol. Then at check in, Belinda was amazing and really took care of us.Our Sands Premier Suite far exceeded our expectations. It was on level 40 of Tower 1 with a stunning view overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Strait. Apparently this floor has been recently renovated so the fittings and furnishings were all new. At 95m2 there was plenty of room with a living room, bedroom, walk in robe and large bathroom. We could have spent most of our stay in the room but the hotel has much to offer.After a stroll through the shopping area, we went up to the rooftop pool which is open late. This is one of the main reasons we stayed at MBS and it certainly lived up to our expectations.  There are plenty of dining and entertainment options from a large food court through to fine dining options such as Tetsuya’s. We made the point of booking a lounge at Ce La Vi to watch the sunset one night - it has a view of the city skyline and you can watch the Spectra light show at 8pm or 9pm.The hotel is 20 minutes from Changi Airport, and is located in close proximity to the city and many other sights and activities so is an ideal base for a visit to Singapore. Amazing!",December 2023,74,5.0
Below average,"Amenities are old. I am currently staying in tower 3. I made complaints about bathroom door too hard to close and open. My 9 year old could not open or close. My back started paining due to offering them to help. I was told by hotel management that they don't have other rooms as hotel is fully booked. I don't believe that was true because rooms were still available to rent online. This is what you get after paying S$1200. I have paid $400- $500 in europe , asia and US, for hotels and they offered better service. No way acceptable. Singapore is small so all location are good. Only reason for 2 star is good view from room and pool. Hotel didn't meet my expectation at all.",December 2023,2,2.0
The Heart of Singapore,The best hotel where one can be in this lifetime. Beautiful high brand showrooms on the ground floor and the enticing rooms on the upper floors with great gardens in between connecting the trio towers.

Amazing,That is the jewel of all hotels and specially the rooftop swimming pool with a breathtaking view and also very good customer service. The atmosphere in the resort is very wonderful and makes you feel very welcomed. One of the best I ever travelled.,February 2024,55,5.0
Too big. Unfriendly. Fullerton hotel much more convivial. Go there instead. Much better in every way,Popped in to see what the fuss is all about  after visiting Gardens in the Bay.Hotel is a magnificent structure but don't expect a warm welcome unless you are staying there. Happy to charge a fortune for drinks but not treat you accordingly. 1/5,February 2024,4,1.0
Unique in the top decile of hotels,"It is an iconic, three-tower luxury hotel noted for its uniqueness, beauty, charm, architecture, infinity pool, roof-top and other fine restaurants, high-end shops, and more. On top of the three towers is a one-hectare aerial garden, which connects the towers. The rooms are exquisitely furnished, charming, and beautiful.",February 2024,"65,227",5.0
Spectacular experience beyond expectations!,"Amazing experience for the whole family. We booked one of the newly renovated Family suites, and I must say that we have never experienced such luxury. Not only the facilities was extraordinary but the hospitality and service from the MBSPremium Services was next level and beyond our expectations. Starting from pre arriving until checking out and after they just took care of us and helped if we needed anything. House keeping was nursing the room every time we left and freshened up everything. We will definitely come back another time!",February 2024,1,5.0
Fantastic experience!!,"We booked two nights at the Marina Sands to end our trip to Singapore.What can possibly be said about staying at such an iconic hotel.The experience alone is amazing and with so much to take in can be a bit overwhelming.( Definitely in a good way ).The roof terrace and pool are just amazing and the views are incredible.We had a fabulous room overlooking the gardens and watched the light show from our balcony.I was taken aback by the structure of this hotel but what impressed me more was the way the staff seemed to run everything so efficiently,from the breakfast on the ground floor which was fine with plenty of choice available,to the bar service by the pool.The check in was straightforward and when we checked out,we were given our pool access cards back which enabled us to enjoy the rest of the day relaxing before our 12:30 am flight home.I must mention the lovely Ivy and Sara whose patience with me at the check in and checkout desks was impeccable.Also Shasi who brought our luggage and told me all about the hotel.A real nice guy.All in all an experience that will be impossible to forget.Iain and Carol Patterson.Newcastle Upon Tyne.",February 2024,10,5.0
A tired accommodation,"Bedding lacked fluffyness, and the hall smelled stale. Breakfast wasn’t good eitherThe room nearby has been under construction for six hours. without prior notice. The noise prevented me from resting comfortably.Despite this noise, the room was not replaced.I heard a hammering from 8:50 a.m. the next day.침구는 푹신함이 부족했고, 홀에서는 퀴퀴한 냄새가 났습니다. 아침식사도 좋지 않았습니다근처 방은 사전 통보 없이 6시간째 공사 중입니다. 소음 때문에 편하게 쉴 수가 없었습니다.이 소음에도 불구하고 방은 교체되지 않았습니다.다음날 오전 8시 50분부터 망치질하는 소리가 들렸습니다.",February 2024,2,1.0
Amazing experience,"The hotel is a marvel and worth the visit if in Singapore, premium suite was stunning, and the staff extremely welcoming and professional. Infinity pool was crowded during the day, however, definitely worth the visit at night time to see the spectacular Singapore skyline.",February 2024,1,5.0
The Marina Bay Sands hotel is perfection at its finest,"We originally booked two king suites for our family of six. We were surprisingly up graded, free of charge to the presidential suite! The staff were absolutely amazing, the bedrooms were stunning, both with breath taking taking views, the suite was immaculately clean and modern.The complimentary breakfast, canopies and drinks, butler and limousine were the icing on the cake to our 2.5 week holiday of south East Asia as well as the amazing ininfinity pool. Thank you Katherine and to all the staff at Marina Bay Sands who go above and beyond to cater to your needs. The customer service is absolutely amazing. We will forever have fond memories of the immaculate Marina Bay Sands hotel and beautiful Singapore that we will treasure dearly forever.",February 2024,2,5.0
Opulent!,A spacious room with a wonderful view of the gardens by the bay. Staff were very helpful and efficient at check in. Balcony was beautiful and much larger than most hotels. Pool and observation deck are very much worth a visit. The hotel is opulent and worth the money for a good nights sleep:),February 2024,125,5.0
best friends in singapore,"When I checked in, I told them that I only speak Japanese, and they called for a Japanese staff member, who was very helpful. He consulted me not only about Marina Bay Sands but also about Singapore and various other matters. Our staff are humble, kind, bright, and have wonderful humanity. I felt like I had made the most reliable friend in Singapore. We also appreciate the information staff who entertained us with simple English during the waiting time. I am honored to have met a gentleman with a wonderful smile. There were so many other great staff members that I would love to be friends with. I would like to visit them again.チェックイン時、日本語しか話せない旨を伝えると日本人スタッフを呼んでくれてとても助かりました。彼はマリーナベイサンズのことだけでなくシンガポールのことや様々な相談にも乗ってくれて嬉しかったです。謙虚で優しくて明るくて素晴らしい人間性を持っているスタッフです。シンガポールで一番信用できる友人ができた気分でした。待ち時間に簡単な英語で私たちを楽しませてくれた案内スタッフにも感謝しています。笑顔が素敵な紳士に出会えて光栄です。他にも友人になりたいと思える最高のスタッフが何人もいました。また彼らに会いに行きたいと思います。",February 2024,3,5.0

Terrible Experience at Hefty Cost,"Post on behalf of husband butnI was one of the occupants. Subject: EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE Although I know MBS will still fully book no matter how bad their services are, no matter how many complaints they receive, but I still wanna share the bad experiences during my stay on the 8 mar.1st Booked 7 rooms, sent email to request check in together for all rooms, reservation team replied ok, but during check in, front desk was unfriendly and said cannot check in together because I was not there and my wife checked in for me. My wife requested high floor and only given 7th floor, and she requested to check in together so that my guests will not get low floor, but front desk person said will try their best, so wife requested the lady to prepare all keys and I only need to retrieve when I reached with guests. The front desk lady said ok but when I reached with guests, front desk took 1 HOUR to give me key cards!!! Really really bad!! All the promises were all lies!! My guests are extremely disappointed all due to MBS EMPTY PROMISE AND inflexibility and rigid staff. Despite me paying so much but not getting the right treatment is just basically horrible. 2nd, we got 7th floor room and there was strong sewage smell, wife told the housekeeping but She gave only diffuser and explained cannot do much because smell from drain. The housekeeping lady was nice but she couldn't do much and Wife needed to go off and front desk packed so couldnt request for room change. Ended up we believed the sewage smell or diffuseR cause my son's nose to be sensitive and did not feel well after spending the night there. Really really bad!!! Spent 10k yet stayed in sewage smell room, emailed MBS ask for compensation and yet MBS person said no compensation. Of course la, they wont bother small business from me, they no need do any nice thing hotel also full, so why would they bother about my complaint right! They called me to say sorry but useless la... The sewage smell was obviously full of bacteria.3rd, the worst part ---we went for breakfast at Spago and my wife almost ingested a part of chipped handglove is really atrocious and disgusting. I seriously thinking of cirluating the photo around but my wife's stopping me from doing so. I was not there with wife, because I was busy, if I were there, should really post the disgusting glove in porridge. They took the glove rather quickly though. So they waived off the breakfast but I think that was only fair because we didnt even eat anything after that disgusting glove! I WANT TO HIGLIGHT THIS, how can a hotel claiming to be a 5 star hotel making such unacceptable nonsense mistake? Totally atrocious. I paid a lot of money for the smelly room with unhygienic retaurant.Sent few emails but no reply until say will.pst FB, so called to say sorry, which really useless. Compensation should be given but like i said, their business good so they cant be bothered. I am extremely angry, disappointed and unhappy with my stay at MBS, share with you all la to make this known or I feel sibei imbalance. 10K le!! Yet worth less than 1k for sure!",March 2024,3,1.0
Nice Room - mediocre service,"Booked a gardens view room but got offered a city view suite in Paiza wing at no extra cost.  Overbooked?.  Very luxy suite with electronic everything, including toilet!.  Lots happening city side and it turned out a good decision to swap views.  Hotel is vast with a 20 minute walk min to most restaurants in the Shoppes mall. Gardens by bay light show is underwhelming and can be viewed from observation deck anyway.  Very impersonal mega hotel - mediocre to poor service.",March 2024,4,3.0
Marina Bay world class,Amazing hotel and loved the facilities. Being someone that enjoys the gym I was so pleased with Chanuk and Oddie who served me and provided great tour of the gym and was blown away. They are a credit to the hotel.Must visit hotel and experience,March 2024,1,5.0
An amazing experience at the Marina Bay Sands,The team at Marina Bay Sands really created a phenomenal experience earlier this month when we stayed there for our Taylor Swift concert trip. The amazing Butler team made the whole trip so seamless for all of us. Thank you Danial and Brady. Of course there are few others we don’t know all the names. It was an amazing experience of the lifetime that my goddaughters would never forget. THANK YOU for your hospitality. You are really impressive!,March 2024,8,5.0

Amazing experience at MBS with superb hospitality and services,"I booked the Sands Premiere Suite to celebrate my anniversary with my fiancé. We received amazing services from The Premium Services, a major shoutout to Eunice for her amazing hospitality and making our Anniversary celebration an especially memorable one. Its definitely one of our best staycays; the room looks even better than the photos, the bath tub was so big, and the amenties were well maintained. The hospitality and services provided by all the service staff were top notched and highly professional. We highly recommend it for any celebrations :)",March 2024,1,5.0
Incredibile,"Nina is amazing as all the team, I loved her hands and the facial massage . The spa is a beautiful location at mbs and the final treats are amazing. Please go if you have the chance, this is quite expensive but it worth, great experience with my friends",March 2024,2,5.0
No one will care about your requests at this hotel.,"1st night so far and extremely disappointed.Checked in after midnight. Paid full rate and upgraded to a premium room at over $1000 per night.Notified hotel about our super late checkin days in advance and requested a room on higher level and close to Elevator.After waiting 35 minutes to be checked in, we were given the lowest level and as a result due to lower level , long walk away from the elevator.Much worse than not caring about our requests was the interaction with front desk,1st manager did noting and her manager came out repeating exactly what the 1st person was sayings: simply ""sorry thats all we have ""If you care about customer experience, this place is NOT IT.5 STAR HOTEL acting as a 2 star hotel when it comes to customer service.Will see how the remaing 2 nights go and will post an update.",February 2024,12,1.0
More than appreciation,"Excellent in all areas. Especially the air quality is very good, great ventilation. Room accommodations and amenities are perfect. Services and support also called as perfection. I can't complain anything. Just wanna give tons of likes to this hotel and theirs staff.",February 2024,3,5.0
What an experience,"Wow. Firstly, as a quick “down side”, be warned that there are a lot of people in the foyer. But even though there are lots of people, the customer service team have a knack for seeking you out amongst the crowd to see if you need anything. How they manage to know who is who is beyond me. Room is impressive. But the real highlight is of course the infinity pool and deck. It’s magnificent and the service that comes with it is what makes it so iconic. Thank you to Christy who treated my 5 year old son like he was royalty. Despite the price, the deck is considerably child friendly (I thought it wouldn’t be). There is a separate adults only section to prevent annoying relaxed adults. Food and beverage was fantastic but be prepared, it’s pricey I found the cafe downstairs (Bloom) decently priced for a coffee and croissant. All in all, an iconic experience worth doing once in your lifetime.",February 2024,12,5.0
Great service but too many people for us,"We stayed here for 4 nights in Tower 3 on the 20th floor. It is a bucket list place to see and stay and like others have commented the staff is great!! So friendly and will go out of their way to assist. Ziu from the bell desk gets a 10 plus. He assisted us with our luggage when we were checking. The pool is great but the first time we went in the afternoon there were no lounge chairs anywhere near the pool. Reminds me of the situation on a cruise ship. Sky deck is on floor 56. They do not make it convenient at all for people staying at the hotel to get back to their rooms. Had to go to first floor and go back inside to get to our tower elevator. Then there is the crowds. If you are not a fan of lots of people, might want to re-think staying here. Restaurant prices are quite high and very little selection for a reasonably priced breakfast. The Origin+Bloom was close to affordable for a coffee and croissant. We had a great view to see the light show at 745pm at Gardens by the Bay.",February 2024,54,4.0
"Consistently great experience at The Banyan Tree Spa, MBS","I have always enjoyed my monthly trips to Banyan Tree Spa at Marina Bay Sands.What makes my trips worthwhile is the Master Therapist Experience which is one of their signature treatment. Sand was the assigned therapist for my last two sessions and her techniques are therapeutic.  Without fail she would unknot the tight spots troubling my shoulders and lower back and I would leave the spa feeling reinvigorated.Also commendable is the professional and friend disposition of the front desk receptionist, Ernita.  She is conscientious and takes pains to ensure that both check-in and check-out processes are seamless and efficient.  This includes follow up email confirmations on next appointments.",February 2024,1,5.0
FITNESS CENTER OF MARINA BAY SAND HOTEL IS AWESOME!,I really like The Fitness Center in Marina Bay Sand Hotel. Because all equipment is so Complete! The Amenities also are perfect! And also i Love the service and hospitality of Lucy & Rosalind.

Banyan tree,"Great relaxing experience. Good clean shower facilities. Lisa is a very experienced professional therapist, and Ernita is always so cheerful and friendly at the door  while being attentive to our needs. Ends off with a healthy snack. Highly recommended for weary bones or even just a revitalising weekend getaway.",February 2024,2,5.0
WORTH THE AMAZING EXPERIENCE,"Spent 2 nights here a a little reward for both of us after a hard 4 months. It’s not cheap but wow, it’s an amazing place. From arrival by van to a chaotic entrance, we both wondered what check in would be like. Not a worry, the whole register and check in was so fast and easy, we were both impressed. It didn’t stop there. Room not ready so given 2 cards to the Skyroof Infinity Pool. The surprises continue. It’s a massive pool spanning across the 3 towers and on the 57th floor. Plenty of chairs, lots of room in the pool and really prompt service for food and drink. A special mention for Mark who looked after us each day. The views of Singapore from the pool deck are breathtaking. One side is the City and the other side is the Harbor which resembles a full car park of ships waiting to load or unload. Received a phone call to advise our room was ready. Rooms are very well appointed as you would expect for the price. Only issue was the provided pillows were like bricks. A quick call to housekeeping and that was resolved quickly. Check out was even faster, an express reader that swallows your  room cards and emails a settled account. The only suggestion we could make is there is absolute nowhere to sit in the building. Everything is expensive but as a treat very much worth the experience.",February 2024,247,5.0
Great experience at MBS gym,"The gym staff were attentive and address my questions. The drinks counter was well stocked after a gym workout to cool down. Not to mention that Chanok, Uma, Affa and Anant were welcoming and made my stay comfortable and memorable. The gym was located away from the hotel, a considerable walk from the rooms. Would love to have the gym back at level 55 again.",February 2024,1,4.0

Beautiful rooftop pool,"We went to Singapore specifically to enjoy this hotel and it did not disappoint. The hotel is beautiful both inside and out. Staff were friendly and efficient. Housekeeping were in and out checking everything and missing nothing. We stayed in a premium suite with a beautiful view. The room was fully electronic with everything at the touch of a button. When you open your door lights and tv turn on, curtains open. The bathroom had the most amazing toilet/ bidet which was all at the touch of a button including individually programmable. (It’s the little things)The rooftop pool was beautiful. Towels, sunscreen and lemon water were there for your use. There was also drink and food service. The hotel also had a walkway to the shops, casino and metro train which we used and found convenient and less expensive than taking taxis.There is a little cafe which we used for breakfast and it offered tea, coffee, juice, breakfast sandwiches, yogurt etc. Simple yet filling and delicious. Definitely a must stay if you are visiting Singapore",January 2024,3,5.0
Best In Town,"The gym service provides a well-equipped facility with a variety of workout options. uma, odi and chano very helpful and is knowledgeable and friendly, creating a welcoming atmosphere.

Highly recommended for fitness enthusiasts seeking a premium workout environment.",January 2024,1,5.0
Fantastic experience!,What a beautiful hotel.  The staff were warm and welcoming.  Our room was great.  Views are spectacular.  Fantastic restaurants to choose from.  Shop till you drop if you like that sort of thing.  It’s a quick 20 min drive to Changi.  Definitely worth the price tag though it is a bit steep.,January 2024,78,5.0
Luxury hotel but services dont match the high price,"We were really looking forward to staying at this hotel. There were some positives and some negatives. Although we gave the hotel a 4 stars, there were still negatives. The 4 stars were mostly due to the hotel architecture itself. It is a beautiful, well designed hotel, rooms are really nice and very modern, with lots of upgrades.Now for the negatives. The hotel was extremely busy so check-in process took a very long time. In fact we had two rooms and one of the rooms was not ready for hours. The rooftop pool on the top of the hotel was crazy busy. We could not find a place to sit. Looks like there are a lot of one night stay guest who just want to experience the hotel for a night. The breakfast buffer on the top floor next to the rooftop pool left a lot to be desired. The breakfast was not that great. We expected better for the quality of the hotel. We asked for a late checkout and was told no late checkout allowed. We spent good money for two rooms and thought one hour late checkout was not a lot to ask for. They did offer to store our luggage and provide a room to change but we could not stay in our room for an hour extra.It is a pretty pricey hotel. Nice hotel and its really a choice if you want to spend the high price to stay there. The services could have been better for such a pricey hotel.",July 2023,159,4.0
Best hotel gym ever!,"I’ve been travelling for work and pleasure for 30 years, this is the best hotel gym I’ve ever had the pleasure to attend in Australia or Asia. Great weights set up with free weights which is not common, dumbbells up to 40kg if you’re heaps stronger than me. Also heaps of cardio machines super attentive staff exemplified by Oddie and Chanok, looking after your every need. If you stay at the hotel and are interested in fitness it’s a must visit.",January 2024,1,5.0

Deafening construction noise for hours.,"Terrible.  Very loud construction that they don’t tell you about until check in.  Say they will move you if it bothers you.  It was deafening and when you call they say sorry, we can’t move you.  It was so loud, for hours.  Do. It book until it is done. It will totally ruin your stay.",January 2024,23,1.0
Tourist processing factory,"This hotel has five star rooms and facilities but is essentially a tourist processing factory.  They offer what they offer, there is no variation to the standard fare. If you complain about anything the staff apologise but do nothing about it.",January 2024,32,2.0
Good Service!,"Good service from the Fitness Centre specially for Umah and Oddie! Cheers and keep up the good job! Always come here to the old gym before but now bigger but no sauna, hot pool and steam room. Hopefully soon they will put more equipments and sauna.",January 2024,1,5.0
Great gym facilities,I went to the fitness center and it was a lovely experience. Uma and Alfa were very attentive to my needs and offered me complimentary tea after my workout.Their workout equipment is high quality and complete. I had no trouble completing my workout. The locker room and shower facilities were also very good.,January 2024,1,5.0
Bucket list hotel,"We splurged to stay here for the final night of our Singapore stopover. We were lucky to get upgraded to a newly renovated room overlooking the park, and it was pure luxury. So this review comes with the caveat that we did not pay full price for the room we got. If we'd stayed in the lower room type we actually booked (which was still incredibly expensive), our review would only be 4 stars because it wouldn't have been as special.Moving on... The lobby was busy but there were helpful staff to direct us, and check-in was relatively easy. We tried using the app but it wouldn't sync our booking to our room (possibly because of the upgrade?).The rooftop pool is as amazing as everyone says. Unfortunately we had bad weather and didn't get to fully enjoy it, but can't blame the hotel for that. If you get a room overlooking the park, you can enjoy the Supertree light show from the comfort of your room! Great for us since it was raining during the show, so we didn't have to risk getting soaked.They kindly gave us access to a shower room after check-out so we could freshen up before our evening flight home. It was basically a small hotel room (no bed) with the bathroom stocked with amenities, plus water bottles and snacks. Amazing!It's important to note that all the shops and restaurants in the adjoining mall have significantly inflated prices. Even Starbucks and Din Tai Fung (dumpling restaurant) were way more expensive than at other Singapore locations. On that note, we highly recommend Origin + Bloom cafe in the lobby for a coffee and pastry.Would we stay here again? We wouldn't come back until all rooms have been renovated, to ensure it's the special experience you'd expect for the price you pay.",January 2024,117,5.0
The perfect anniversary celebration experience,"The perfect experience for an Anniversary celebration, thank you to all the MBS team! From the pre-hotel transfer arrangement, to the welcome surprise, to even more lovely surprises, we were spoiled beyond belief. It was our 30th dating anniversary and I chose a Suite at MBS to spend a special night with my wife. We enjoyed the whole experience: the room was fantastic, the service was incredible, the attention to detail second to none, the pool lovely as always, breakfast was good. We got help from the team booking a last minute reservation for dinner at one of the MBS restaurants, which was fantastic, but our choice of restaurant was not as good as others we've had before at MBS. Still very grateful to the MBS team - you guys rock!",March 2024,35,5.0
Wonderful stay.,"I usually find hyped up hotels disappointing but not Marina bay sands hotel. It was amazing and lived up to the reviews. The infinity pool was superb as were the helpful staff, finding me a pod to sit in as I had to stay out of the sun. The room was beautifully appointed with nice little added touches, bookmarks and cable ties left by room staff and a soft drink complimentary bar with crisps. The two breakfasts restaurants were excellent with fabulous choice. Perhaps the most pleasing aspect was that we had booked 3 nights but had to check out a night early as we had made a mistake with our flight and Judith, the manager agreed to just charge us for 2 nights. This was very much appreciated. Thank you to all the wonderful staff at marina bay sands.",March 2024,17,5.0
Great to see,"It was an amazing experience inside the Marina bay sands, luxurious and artistic. Went to the other shopping side to see a wonderful canal ride. Venice like setting inside the luxury all around. It had a great casino also to have a look around.",January 2024,54,4.0
Relaxing and tuning in to self through various textures of sound,"What a lovely way to start the morning! Peaceful with serene morning breeze and awesome sights of Singapore.

Good customer service,"Roselyn was very professional and attentive during her shift. Cheers!Definitely felt the price was worth it during my stay here at the gym.

Excellent infinity pool,"The pool is amazing and most rooms have some view. The hotel is kind of set like a Vegas hotel with many stores and restaurants inside the hotel. The rooms are of decent size and the breakfast in the top restaurant has great atmosphere. There are many things to do to keep yourself occupied along with it, many popular attractions are close by.",December 2023,6,5.0
Chris at the Gift Shop Practically saved us!,"Went to stay at MBS while I do medical check up, can absolutely say their service is amazing especially Chris at the gift shop, we were in need of a umbrella as it was raining heavily late at night and I guess the gift store was about to close but Chris from the Gift Shop, reopen the counter and even asked us if there is anything else we need! Superb hospitality even from the Gift Shop. Top Notch",February 2024,1,5.0
Bucket Luxury Hotel Experience,"We stayed in this iconic hotel for a bucket list night.  We did all our Singapore touring before we had our 1-night stay so that we could enjoy the hotel amenities the WHOLE time without leaving the property.  We spent a lot of time at the pool.  It rained one afternoon, but we were the first ones back in the pool once it was cleared from the lightning storm.  The Infinity pool gets high ratings.  Wasn't too crowded and we were able to get the seating right next to the pool.We enjoyed our balcony the most --recommend facing the Gardens.  We were able to sit back, relax, and watch the Gardens by the Bay Light show.",January 2024,441,5.0
The hotel is perfect!,"The experience of staying for 3 days in this  hotel is fantastic, because of the great and professional services from Eunice Marasigan , everything is perfect!

"Marina Bay Sands , always our first choice for a stay cation.","When it comes to booking a stay cation, Marina Bay Sands is always the first thing that comes in our mind. This is my family's first choice for stay cation. Even though it is not our first time in MBS, the excitement were still there, especially for my kids. MBS became their standard for a stay cation which we haven't found any match yet.During our stay, I would like to commend the services of the staffs, especially those assigned in the infinity pool and concierge. Mr Cornelius was very kind and polite when we checked-in.When we are in the infinity pool, Mr Dennis, Mr Ramon and Ms Vicky were very friendly and courteous, especially Mr. Dennis.Mr. Dennis has showed the hospitality trait of being a Filipino. He always checks on us and other guests if we are okay and enjoying the infinity pool.

Best hotel experience ever (and we’ve been around;-),"We had the best hotel experience of our lifetime at the Marina Bay sands hotel even if we have been traveling a lot around the world as diplomats over the last 25 years. It’s not only because of the newly renovated suite that was amazing (decoration of exquisite good taste, the technology, the stunning view both on the city and the garden), the amazing swimming pool at the 57th floor, the great food at the different restaurants but most importantly, the service and the kindness of the different people we met in particular KC at the check in, Patrick at the welcome desk, Ganeson for the luggages and Guna at the swimming pool. Thanks to them, we have only one idea : coming back again as soon as we can.",January 2024,2,5.0
Breath taking views from the bar atop the hotel and the pool is awesome!,"Pros and cons. The place was packed on a Friday night! Hotel to restaurant at the top so getting around was not easy. Also the prices are high for drinks. Now the Pros.... the staff is great at the bar and sitting watching the hotel guests swim in that amazing swimming pool on the top floor with the view is really priceless! If you are in Singapore, other than the airport, this is a must see place and be sure to hit the bar on the top floor to see the pool (yes, same pool from the movie filmed there)... haha.",November 2023,73,4.0
Awesome workout experience,"Excellent service at fitness center. Awesome staff Roselyn and Lucy as both of them are very accommodating, friendly and cheerful 😀 Very convenient location as it is just across the marina bay sands hotel right at mice convention center. Level 3. View from the treadmill is very relaxing as it is facing inside the mall where the shops are overlooking unlike normal gym facing on a blank wall. A fitness center with right staff is a perfect combination. Thank you.",December 2023,1,5.0

"Yes, it is as unique as everyone says!","WOW!  I have been traveling to Singapore for over 35 years and just went back to visit some friends and decided we would splurge and experience the famous MBS!It did not disappoint!   First, a very sincere shout out to Shei Manda, a relatively new front desk employee who checked us in.  There was a long line and for some reason she was struggling to get our room arranged.  I had some trouble pre-registering with the APP and she was able to overcome all of that and not only solved the problem, but some how, and for some reason, was able to upgrade us to a VIP room.   I have traveled my entire working career and have had some nice upgrades but nothing compared to this.  Two room Suite, with butler, and to many amenities to count. Great room, great bed, great TV's (yes, biggest TV's in a hotel ever)Great room service.No need to comment about the pool, it is every bit as iconic as people say.Service is second to none.We will certainly be back and highly recommend this for a special event.",January 2024,10,5.0

Excellent Service and Experience,"Had a 1 night stay between connections, arrived around 10am, checked in, our baggage was put into storage and we were given a temporary card to use facilities before our room was available, which wasn't till 3pm.. This allowed us to go onto the sky deck and use the infinity pool.  Next day we checked out at 11. Was again given temporary cards to use for the day until 8pm! We were provided with a room for a shower before leaving the hotel for 45 mins. It was exceptional service, beautiful hotel, great location. Lovely food. Couldn't have asked for more.",January 2024,6,5.0
Great gym,This Gym at marina bay sands mall was fantastic and cosy with free weights and machines. Nice drinks too! Oh yeah the theragun massage guns were so therapeutic you have to try it.

Disappointed;bad room assignment,"Everything was amazing on check in. Great staff, great service and amazing spacious room in Tower 3  - spot on what we expected when booking. What was NOT expected was the horrendous construction that was going on upstairs flooding our entire room. I was so angry. On booking, I paid a small additional sum for my 6month old baby as a ‘guest’. I notified them that we have a baby, and they even put a cot and a baby bath in the room EXCEPT they also put us downstairs from 9-6 construction. My little baby, who is meant to do 3-4naps a day would not stop crying and both my husband and I had to escalate escalate escalate over a 3hr period, where I ended up sitting in the hallway in tears too, before we were given an adequate replacement room by one of the Guest Service Managers, Xavier. Terrible experience; having stayed at MBS many times in the past - I was shocked at their oversight and the time it took to rectify.Other reasons for my rating include  a very mediocre breakfast. The chef we had on both mornings couldn’t get our omelettes right (we wanted fresh eggs, instead of the pre-made egg mix and egg whites); we end up just eating croissants and mini muffins that were pretty dry.MBS is in a perfect location for shopaholics: that is one of the reason I maintained the 3 stars rating.",January 2024,78,3.0
Terrible experience,"We normally stay at the Four Seasons when in Singapore and it was a big mistake staying here on our visit this time.  Outdated rooms no where near a five star standard.   The beds were so hard and felt like sleeping on wood.  Bath towels were small and felt like sandpaper.  When we provided our feedback to the hotel their response was that rooms in our tower 3 had not been renovated unlike rooms in tower 1 and 2 so they offered us a token $100 credit.  Check in took 40 minutes to find interconnecting rooms for our young children.  Incredibly they first suggested we take  rooms on the opposite sides of the floor.  20 minute wait for seating at breakfast.  I could go on.  Lesson learnt, will not be staying here again.",January 2024,2,1.0
Terrible experience.,"Don’t stay at this hotel. The room smelled as if someone had been sick, the mattress was uncomfortable and you had to queue for check in and queue 15 minutes for breakfast at the pool level. Once they did seat you they didn’t even pour you a glass of water. If you are looking for a 5 star property there are much better options.",December 2023,3,1.0
Beautiful hotel.Great views,"Beautiful hotel, must see on a visit to Singapore.If you are cruising and have a overnight stop in Singapore.Book a table at a rooftop restaurant (Save $60+) by going here instead of the Observation level then spend it at the bar.Best to book a table as it’s hard to get to to a restaurant without booking.",December 2023,27,5.0

Great staff who gave us a once in a lifetime experience with exceptional service,"We had the most outstanding experience at Marina Bay Sands.  From the moment we checked in, the hospitality, friendliness and service was exceptional.  Yve who checked us in was knowledgeable, attentive  and her customer service skills were excellent.  Once checked into our suite, Marvin our Butler greeted us at the lifts and escorted us to our room.  We're very grateful for Marvin's enthusiasm for his role, his friendliness and excellent service.   Nothing was too much trouble as he helped organise our stay from booking a poolside cabana, afternoon drinks & canapes and a sunrise breakfast to name a few of the experiences.  He even hand made a beautiful birthday card and brought us a delicious cake to acknowledge and celebrate the birthday event which was the reason for our trip.Every aspect of our suite was superbly luxurious and included amazing city and sea views.  Relaxing by the Infinity Pool overlooking the beautiful city views of Singapore was also a highlight.  Wherever we went, the staff were friendly, engaging and nothing was too much trouble.  Club @ Renku, Spago, Ce La Vie, Concierge & Luggage services, Poolside Bar, Limousine service,  Yve, Marvin and Christelle at the airport...across all these areas, it is true to say customer service at Marina Bay Sands is outstanding.Thank you again to everyone at Marina Bay Sands.

Very poor,"Arrived on the Wednesday after a long flight from Paris. After getting something to eat we thought it would be nice to get a drink back at the hotel. The first bar we tried at the top of tower 1 was closed for a private function. We were advised to try the bar at the top of tower 3. Went there only to be advised  that if we wanted to sit at one of the reserved tables, and they were all reserved, there was a minimum spend of $1000. Being just my wife and I we were not going to get anywhere near this. Absolutely ridiculous for a hotel that claims to care about the customer experience! We had booked in for 4 nights and thought it might be nice to move to a hotel that actually cares about their guests only to be told that we could get a refund for the unused nights it would take 4 weeks to process. Ended up having a drink in a restaurant on the ground floor, not the 57th floor with all the views. This hotel claims it’s 5 star but in terms of their attitude to their paying guests they are not even one star.  My recommendation is to find a hotel where they actually care about their guests.",December 2023,23,1.0

I Love This Hotel,"I was in Singapore and knew I had to stay here, I booked a room for us on a Sunday night and was so happy I made the effort to do so, I was in 2 minds whether to book,  its an American Vegas style hotel in Asia but it was so worth it you get the fantastic service and hospitality of Singapore but the fun aspect of an American Vegas style hotel. Our check in was seamless Patrick was lovely Peach very helpful and May upgraded us, so we were super happy. Our room was on the 39 floor overlooking the gardens, so nice for the show in the evening (although I would recommend actually being in the gardens for it to get a better experience,if your not there for the show do have a walk around its lovely, the animal sculptures of endangered species is very moving)  You walk into your room and the curtains open, a nice touch with a great view. The decor was lovely with some very nice design touches, beds were amazing, bathroom super luxe and toiletries were Jo Malone also being upgraded you get a much nicer robe which becomes obvious when you are at the pool! The pool... so worth it! there is an adults section which is great however being a Sunday there wasn't too many children about, the beds get busy but there is a constant turn around 1 thing we didn't realise there is sun screen provided near the area you do the pool check in. As only hotel guests can use the roof top infinity pool it makes you feel special! the pool is 1 of the reasons to stay at the hotel and it really was a fantastic view and yes I got lots of pictures of me at the edge like in the advert for the hotel! We ate at the pool so food was from Spago a Californian restaurant with a very nice menu, while I was staying elsewhere I came to MBS and ate at CUT by Wolfgang Puck which I highly recommend the chicken is enormous it arrived as a full bird 1.1 kg they took it away and carved it for me. While staying at MBS we ate at the new French restaurant DB Bistro which we didn't enjoy so much maybe it was not to our taste? We visited the casino, free to tourists but $150 for locals!  you must have your passport and Singapore landing card to enter. No quite as much fun as a Vegas casino the games are a little different and the gambling seemed more intense, but we had to give it a go and it was a nice finish to our evening. I read a lot about this hotel and on my visit to eat there before my stay there I was a little shocked how busy it was and felt it was almost a little too touristy, but that aside the architecture is totally amazing,  the staff superb, if you love to shop the mall is great every shop you could possible wish for if you like high end, the evening light and water shows are a nice touch and I must say my whole experience was 10/10 we loved it, would I return now that I have done the pool and casino YES I would.",February 2024,92,5.0
Average,"Although the hotel is spectacular to look at, it’s very average to stay in. The room we stayed in was very tired with stained carpet and stained robes. The pool is beautiful but not easy to swim in as not surprisingly is used as personal photo shoot for the guests. Guests appear to be lazy with leaving towels on beds so you never know which beds are free. The staff are lovely and helpful. We are glad we stayed here for the experience but if we return to Singapore, we will probably stay elsewhere",March 2024,32,3.0

The rooms floor to ceiling windows with the Amazing view and the luxurious toiletries are and plus.  The bed is comfortable but it’s really just a blip on the radar.  Now for the Rooftop Pool yes it was Everything I’d hoped for.  Now the staff throughout are Amazing we went to the front desk looking for a ATM and one of the Lobby Ambassadors escorted us all the way to where the ATM was located near the casino.  I’d like to give a special thank you to Lobby Ambassador Mr. Patrick and Bell Captain Mr. Suresh Rao you both were very kind and beyond helpful during our stay,March 2024,20,4.0
A great experience,"This hotel is really massive. However the rooms are very nice, we had a great view over the gardens by the bay with the super trees. Our room was spacious and provided a great place to relax.Breakfast can get a bit busy, so to avoid queueing up I would suggest arriving for breakfast at around 8:0am. There is plenty of selection at breakfast and the staf are efficient.The hotel is connected to the MRT, Shopping mall and casino so its very easy to get around. The super tree grove, Floral fantasy, Cloud forest and flower dome are all within walking diatance.The infinity pool at the rooftop is great for one of those photo opportunities, as is the observation deck. Both are free for guests. The pool is for guests only, whilst the observation deck is chargeable for non guests.This hotel does not come cheap! But its location is perfect.Staff are helpful.

The best hotel in Singapore,"Marina Bay Sands is hands down my favorite hotel in all of Singapore. I stayed in the newly renovated rooms in tower 2 and had a beautiful view of the Gardens by the Bay. The mall attached is breathtaking and the hotel offers so many restaurants you can’t go wrong with any of them. Lavo was amazing for a rooftop experience (highly recommend the meatball!) , Wakudu had the freshest fish if you’re looking for high end Japanese cuisine, and you can’t go wrong with room service. Every part of the hotel is a work of art. Almost every part is a picturesque moment! The rooftop pool is breathtaking and is the best view in Singapore. Also, Marquee is the coolest club you’ll ever go to. A Ferris wheel and slide attached that you can’t miss.Most of all, the employees and premium services were extremely catering, helpful and fast. Shoutout to Eunice from Premium Guest Services for going above and beyond each day of my stay. She gave me all the best recommendations and she was swift with all my responses. She also assisted me with all my rides to and from the hotel with ease.This hotel has it all! If you’re just visiting, I highly recommend staying for at least 2 nights to explore all MBS has to offer! -T",February 2024,1,5.0
Utter bliss,"Oh wow. What an amazing stay. We requested two standard rooms overlooking the gardens on the same floor. On arrival one of the rooms was not ready so they upgraded us to a two bedroom suite with a city view. It has spoilt us for ever.  Two nights of bliss. Treated like VIP’s and could not fault anything.  The attention to detail was amazing and the quality of the furnishings, bed linen, toiletries were just beautiful. Even the toilet was awesome. We didn’t want to leave.  The pool was fabulous but the suite just made our stay. Thank you Kath and MBS for an unforgettable experience!",February 2024,3,5.0
not sure i would go back,"we went last summer. it is architecturally very impressive, but the hotel is so big that the service does not feel very personal. we arrived early and asked if we could check in early but this did not seem possible. the hotel lobby has no comfortable seating areas so we asked if we could find somewhere comfortable to sit, but this did not seem possible. as the hotel is such a landmark, the lobby is full of tourists and visitors, so as a resident you never feel the quality of the service. the restaurants, shopping mall, infinity poor and viewing deck are all amazing but you just do not get the personalised service a 5 star hotel should give you.",July 2023,56,3.0
The most incredible hotel,One of the best hotels in the World that I have stayed in and I have stayed in many luxury hotels due to my job.  From the minute we arrived we were met at the door and escorted to our rooms where check in took place which was seamless and so efficient. The rooms are out of this world and spotless and the attention to detail was fantastic. Breakfast is superb! The staff are incredible from the pool staff to the restaurants staff but the best service we had was we had booked a departure transfer to the airport which was late arriving due to a mix up but was handled very well.  When we arrived at the airport there were 2 staff members from the hotel waiting for us to assist us to the tax refund and check in- I have never had such service in my 45 years in the industry all I can say if you can stay at this hotel it is a once in a lifetime experience.Thank you for making our trip memorable!,February 2024,15,5.0

He had booked a premium room with city view however on arrival we were upgraded to a suite. Han who booked us in could not have been any more helpful. Everything about this hotel is amazing. The infinity pool is just wow. Thank you to everyone at the Marina bay from the booking staff, our butler, the guys who moved our luggage, the catering staff and not to forget the cleaners.

Must see in Singapore,A must not miss place for tourists to visit when in Singapore. It's a pretty nice place to take a walk and enjoy the view. Plenty of people from locals to tourists.

Memorable staycation,"We had a staycation to celebrate a special moment at MBS. Inspite of my initial scepticism, it kept getting better with every experience - starting with an unsolicited upgrade of our room to a suite with a breathtaking view, later followed by a brilliantly served dinner/drinks. But the highlight of the stay was - our morning session of sound meditation on L-57 under the open sky. It was conducted by Karuna who was kind enough to share his own story as well. Simply brilliant and a powerful session to reset myself.",March 2024,82,5.0

Still a world famous hotel with very attentive staff,"Stayed here for one night during our honeymoon and received a free room upgrade to a deluxe bayview room. Very uncomplicated check-in process and attentive staff. The infinity pool is more like a public swimming pool and totally overcrowded. People (especially influencers) tend to go there to take pictures only and not enjoy the view itself, which is a bit annoying. But that itself is probably part of the concept and why Marina Bay Sands is famous all over the world. Our room was one of the newer rooms and everything was clean and tidy. Room service also worked without any problems. We also had a great view at the light show in the Marina Bay at night. Definitely a must stay when you are in Singapore.",September 2023,72,5.0

What an experience.  Wished we had booked 2 nights,"Lovely hotel and staffWe booked 1 night stay as a treat to be able to use the infinity pool.  What an experience.  Wished we had booked 2 nights.Check in and was told we had been given a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite from  Premium King for 3 people.  Arrived and as we opened the door all the automatic lights came on , curtains opened with a view across the harbour and down onto the Supertree Grove.  We were celebrating a birthday which I had noted on reservation and we had a birthday cake delivered to the room by the butler.  Did not even know we had one !!.   Room was not ideal for 3 people but we made the best of it abd used the facilites that were on offer.  They even had a karoke set up in the living room so we had a great time using that.  Never felt so spoilt.Only issue was within 24 hours of checking out the hotel took an additional cost charge for something out of the minibar which we did not have.  Despite confirming with the butler are other additional charges",February 2024,61,5.0
Beautiful and Excellent Hotel!!!,"This is my first time visiting Singapore and It's  second stop of honeymoon. Marina Bay Sands are very famous, so my wife and I decided to stay at it for two nights when we first arrived at Singapore. We booked the premier suite with city view since it was honeymoon. The hotel team kindly offered us complimentary pick-up and also sent us to our next hotel when we checked out. In-room check in was great. The cake and wine were also very delicious, thanks for that. The hotel is very beautiful and views are great. The rooftop pool is great for the view and I think it looks better at night. The breakfast has very rich selections at the first level restaurant, and I didn't try the breakfast beside the pool. The hotel also has mall and casino, also many good restaurants. Overall, it was really great experience with Marina Bay Sands!  Thanks MBS premium service team Allisa for the quality service. I will definitely stay at Marina Bay Sands again next time when I come to Singapore.",February 2024,10,5.0
"Once in a life time? For the Instagrammers yes, for me NO!",Of course if seems like is must to stay at this iconic hotel when in Singapore. Not being part of the instagram community for me it was not worth the money.Very crowded (also due to Chinese New Year which dod not give me a nice relaxed break moment on this trip. Our room was nothing special in size nor in luxery. It was on the 7th gloor with a view at….. the walls of the shopping malls.Breakfast at the top floor near the iconic pool was expensive but amazing! Food at the pool was very over priced and portions to small.Once in a life time? Maybe for some mot for us!,February 2024,271,3.0

"Not family friendly, treats teens as adults for pool access","MBS is well known but in my opinion overrated. The rooms are overpriced for the type of room you get. I work remotely and take my work with me when I travel. Most 5* hotels have a business center. When I asked the front desk one of the staff was confused as to what a business center was. Another staff then said their business center is in the convention center but it’s all booked. I have a feeling they don’t really know what a business center is and that they don’t have one. I don’t mind working from the room, but I prefer working from a business center or a lounge area. There is no convenient lounge area. This hotel doesn’t even have a real lobby to rest your legs. We were only here for a few days. We also tried their dinner buffet which was very good. Service was a bit slow though it is CNY and a busy time. When we were seated we were informed our champagne would be served right away. It was about after our second round of getting food that our champagne was actually served. Then when we paid the bill our server asked for us to stay at our dining table so they can double check our room number is correct. After waiting for 5-10 minutes the server never came back to let us know we can leave. We had to hunt down help to confirm it was okay to leave the dining area. The other area we accessed was the pool. The worker “Vicky” was checking in guests. I understand the pool is for guests only and you need to swipe a card per adult guest. I have three kids and they claimed my two teenagers ages 15 and 16 are adults. And they would “let me in this time” but next time to register them so they have their own hotel room card to access the pool. I’ve never heard of such a ridiculous requirement and shouldn’t this be something when we were checking in that the front desk advise us of? The hotel is conveniently located with lots of things to do. But I do not consider this place family friend or work travel friendly and likely will not be coming back.",February 2024,26,3.0
The BEST hotel ever!!,"The wonderful experience started with the lovely, short-haired, friendly woman who helped me check in at the front desk. (Maybe her name is Levie?) She is the nicest hotel employee I have ever met! I really appreciate it, thank you very much. In addition to impeccable cleaning, a pleasant smell that fills the room, and sufficient amenities, there are also ample hotel facilities. This is exactly the hotel stay we were looking for. I have never had such a wonderful experience. This is definitely the best hotel. It's worth visiting Singapore just to stay at this hotel. I will definitely stay again. it is really amazing! !",February 2024,1,5.0
Va va voom,"The spa experience was absolutely out of this world. From the moment you step out of the lift to the left landing to the main reception area where you are greeted by warm receptionists and the nicely decorated banyan tree and crystals, to the meeting of the therapist before the spa treatment. Not forgetting the after spa experience!",February 2024,1,5.0
"Nice hardware, horrible software - MBS isn't luxury.","The CNY period is busy for everyone, but most luxury hotels find a way to manage.  Not true for Marina Bay Sands.  The check in experience has been appallingly bad.To not have any rooms available until 3 pm is understandable, albeit inconvenient - but to not have a single seating area available for guests to wait in is absolutely unconscionable.  There are ZERO chairs / couches anywhere on the first floor, they've decided to monetize by giving every last inch to the buffet.My elderly parents are traveling with us, and we had to walk around for 30 minutes looking for a place to sit.  We finally squeezed in a beach in the food court area in the mall to wait an hour for our rooms.I was then called, and specifically told ALL three rooms we booked were available (I made sure to ask).  We all walked back (again - a long distance) to be told, just kidding, only one of the three was currently available.  What should my elderly parents do in that case?Finally, even after we made it to the rooms - it was literally a 45 minute wait for our luggage to arrive.I have traveled extensively around the globe, and Marina Bay Sands ranks amongst the very bottom.  They have an iconic location, the views are nice, the service staff have been trained to smile and say nice things - but it is far, far from a luxurious experience.",February 2024,6,2.0
Amazing service - go elsewhere to fine,"Their service was impeccable.  But unless you're hungry, the buffet at Rise was  overpriced ($300 for two salads and a glass of wine).  Food service was very rushed in Spago (despite there being other tables available, so there was no need to rush us out to turn our table over).  Lavo for dinner was so noisy and crowded we couldn't talk.  Wonderful place to stay - go somewhere else to dine.",February 2024,1,4.0

We spent our time in the infinity pool, gardens by the bay, spectra show, dragon drone show.There is a mall next to the MBS hotel with lot of restaurants. We enjoyed the river cruise from this location and the cruise was almost private with one other couple in the boat however sadly you can't take night time tour as the cruise at this place closes at 5 PM. The Quay has night time cruises and I saw many boating slowing down during the spectra show.",February 2024,121,5.0
Must stay place in Singapore,"Unreal hotel. Room spacious and had a lovely view on the balcony where they have the gardens by the bay, which has light shows every night. Really clean and staff all really nice and helpful. Rooftop pool really is spectacular, unfortunately rained while we were there through the day however we went at night when it stopped and the views were outstanding.

Pure luxury and the highest level of service!,"Although we had a minor issue at check in, the hotel management, namely Victor Mai, took full ownership, kept in touch with us, and resolved the issue way beyond our expectations.This is customer service at the highest level! The hotel is stunning, seriously high end, and there isn’t anything the MBS team won’t do for you to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Our family suite was phenomenal and our girls loved the play room/bedroom (Nintendo Switch). The food here is exceptional. We had breakfast at Rise each morning and had a special anniversary meal at Spago on the rooftop, which was outstanding! I think for what you get at this hotel, its truly value for money, the hotel staff truly care about your comfort throughout your stay and let’s be frank, there are no better views in Singapore than here. Thank you to Victor and the MBS team for making our stay so special and one to remember.We will be back!",February 2024,1,5.0
Excellent Stay at MBS,"I am with my elderly parents and my older brother who flew all the way from Canada to celebrate the 87th and 81st birthday of our Dad and Mom. I booked the 2  Sands Premier Suite  since December 2023 as I wanted to make our parents’ birthday memorable.I emailed the MBS to avail the Merlion Suite originally as we stayed there in July 2022 but unfortunately its apparently under renovation.So I settled for the 2 Sands Premier Suite instead.I roped in the help of MBS n Januat 2024 to have my parents’ room decorated with flowers, balloons, birthday greetings, champagne and fruits and MBS threw in complimentary cakes as well.I also requested 2 wheelchairs and possible early check-in and late check out too.3 days before our visit to MBS , they send a reminder for out check-ins and I confirmed with then all the pre-arranged surprises for my parents.The room reservation, room-in dining , Bayfloral all have confirmed that all the arrangement are smoothly on the way, although some miscommunications happened when I was confirming the arrangements but…What impressed me the most was the MBS premium services that oversee that all the arrangement will happen and more… Ms. Precious, Ms Lucy of MBS premium service and in-room dining addressed all my concerns and Ms. Maria of Bayfloral as well thru our communications via email. MBS premium services sent a message to give them a heads up once we ate on our way, as the 2 wheel chairs will be waiting for us.On the day of our arrival Ms. Eunice Marasigan was waiting for us at the lobby, though I missed the message who are we supposed to meet thus, we alighted from our transportation and proceeded to request for wheelchairs. When Ms. Eunice spotted us that’s where the magic started… from the very start she assisted us with genuine warmth and sincerity, she was honest that the 2 rooms are being prepared as well as the surprises, so she lead us to RENKU for complimentary breakfast  where Sheila assisted us while waiting as Eunice checked in for all of us,and provided us temporary keys for the gym and infinity pool. Since we anticipated that rooms might not be ready yet, we had a lunch reservation at RISE so Sheila of RENKU helped us move to RISE restaurant with all our complimentary drinks in tow.While having our lunch buffet at RISE, Eunice keeps us updated with our rooms( we requested if PAIZAPremier Suite is available instead but unfortunately not), she surprised my parents with cakes and birthday song compliments of RISE staffs( separate review on this).Once our rooms are ready, we were led to it and MBS wowed us with the floral arrangements, balloons and birthday greetings( c/o Bayfloral) adorned the room of my parents and the fruits and Piper-Heidsieck Champagne (c/o MBS in-room dining) with complimentary MBS cakes and fruits as well. My parents were so surprised and overwhelmed!! Goal achieved! Ms.Eunice also helped us how to go to KOMA for our dinner resevation ( separate review) and she also readied our transportation for the next day to our lunch reservation to ATLAS( another review) a complimentary limousine ride. She always updated and assured us during our stay.She come across as a very genuine, sincere staffs who is going above and beyond, MBS is fortunate  to have her as she will definitely brought her A game and made the guests feels very special. Kudos as well to Jeff and Jonald  who assisted us on our check-out and the kind gentleman whom I forgot to get his name who drove is to ATLAS. We woke up late the next day and still tired so we decided to order a in-room dining for breakfast instead of availing our complimentary brekkie to RISE and Spago. It’s very convenient to oraer thru TV and very promptly delivered. Variety of choices too. After that we went to infinity pool but to do photo shoots only as we are rushed for our next appointment.Thank you! All in all, our MBS stay is memorable. We will defintely come back and visit again!",February 2024,95,5.0

Avoid Marina Bay Sands During Construction!,"Just checked out of Marina Bay Sands.  I have stayed at the hotel 15 times before.  Just a word of warning:1. Construction is incredibly noisy from 9 am to 6 pm and on weekends.  It is Loud.  The bed is hard as a rock and I hope they change it out.  2. They were working on the room above us and knocked out the air conditioning and the electric.  3. I never complain and mentioned it a checkout saying paying $1,000 for a room with no AC and packing my bags in the dark is ridiculous.  4 There response was we are sorry, no credit to your $1,000 room and have a nice day.  The only reason you should go to Marina Bay now is if you are dead set on the pool.   The pool is great, but the construction is over the top loud and the hotel really doesn't have to care as there is always another unsuspecting guest.  We are coming to Singapore for the 4th time this year and are staying at the Mandarin Oriental this time.  The only thing I'm missing out on is the Marina pool.",February 2024,17,1.0
Perfect Stay!,"Excellent experience!  Of course the hotel is iconic, but the personal attention and customer service is outstanding.

Glaiza's professionalism and warmth made us feel immediately welcome, while Mark's assistance throughout our stay added a personalized touch that truly set this experience apart.

"Humongous, unique hotel, magnificent pool (but photos taken by photographer are too expensive!)","The main reason I chose this hotel for the second time, is the marvellous infinity pool.

Before sunrise and sunset are not to be missed.The hotel itself is enormous, but most (like the delicious restaurants, the Shoppes and the shows) is also accessible to non-hotel guests. So, make sure to explore this hotel, even if you’re not a guest, it’s an experience in itself.The staff is very friendly, giving tips and helping out when necessary. One time I got out of the pool at 23:51, and my belongings (luckily only my room card inside my hotel bathjacket) were taken away prematurely. So be aware of this if you intend to stay in the pool until midnight to not lose your valuables! I thus had to go to the first floor with a new jacket and towel I had received by the staff at the pool to obtain a new room card.Breakfast was very expensive, so if you consider having breakfast, try allocating more time and making a brunch out of it at the Rise restaurant. This way, you kinda get 2 meals for the same price, which makes it more affordable.The room was good, with a nice view on Gardens By The Bay for us. I would have liked a movable spray head in the shower though, as a fixed one is not handy. The fitness is good enough with various machines, and helps you keep in shape for the duration of your stay.The hotel is expensive though, which is normal for the luxury you obtain in return. The reason which refrains me from giving this hotel 5 stars, is the absurd price of purchasing the photos a photographer has taken of you at the pool itself. The cheapest option was 120 SGD and to get all your photos digitally too, the price becomes 145 SGD, if I am not mistaken. I get that they know their audience is whealthy (otherwise they wouldn’t be able to afford such an expensive hotel), but to me it really feels like a tourist trap. It’s not like the photographer stayed 15 minutes with you to capture you from all the best angles. It was just a minute, some poses at the same spot, and that’s it. Feels like bandwork and not worth more than 20 SGD. Even though, I purchased the photos because I am fascinated by your infinity pool, but it gave a bitter aftertaste which damped my experience a bit. Shout-out to Fir (@firtography1985 on Instagram) though, who volunteered to make great photos of us at the pool at sunrise with our phone! Conclusion: I will certainly come back in the future because I love Singapore, Marina Bay, the restaurants and the Infinity Pool, but reviewing your paid photograph service at the pool would be a good thing.",February 2024,4,4.0

"Appalling stay at MBS, still waiting for recovery from their team days after check out!","I am a local who has been to Marina Bay Sands multiple times. Just to contextualise my stay, I was only at MBS to take some important work calls and to relax while my house was under renovation, but I ended up having to experience so much stress from:1. A security breach issue that I encountered with someone else (not my guest or I) who definitely came into our room to eat one of our snacks in the mini-bar area and subsequently left the empty package beside the room refrigerator (see photo attached);2. Equipment in my room not working (Netflix not syncing to the TV screen in the room);3. Billing issues throughout my stay (where I had to spend more than half my stay calling or emailing their reservations team and also going down to the check-in counter at least 3 times in-person to get my billing issue resolved)4. Not having the room service staff provide me with my birthday amenity first thing upon check-in (the friend who booked my room at MBS kept asking if the hotel did anything for me and I had to wait for hours and ask twice before anything came to my room, and my friend who did my room booking was severely disappointed that I didn’t receive anything for a long while although he put a note in for this upon booking my room);5. Not having my Sands Lifestyle rewards membership card credited with the rewards dollars within 48 hours of my check-out (I am still following up on this issue…)A Nicole Yu from the hotel’s recovery team has done an investigation into the security breach issue where someone in their staff team entered my room to eat from my snack bar (but not to make up my room) while I was away from my room for lunch on the second day of my stay, but they claimed none of the staff who entered my room ate the snack (then who did, a ghost?) and informed me that they couldn’t do anything else for me as I had checked out of the hotel (the issue wasn’t resolved before I checked out anyway…so whose fault is that)? She said I could come back again to experience the hotel but why would I pay to return when I had such a stressful stay at a hotel  that a) Isn’t cheap and b) is supposedly iconic to Singapore?I have photos to share of the empty nut package by my fridge which I discovered in my room, and would like to escalate this matter to someone more senior within the hotel, but Nicole has ghosted me for the past 24 hours. I am only posting here because I haven’t had my issues resolved and am still waiting for someone from their team to get back to me.If you’re thinking of staying at the hotel, be warned…the service is appalling and you’re paying top dollar for this. Just save yourself the stress and the trouble - there are many other better hotels for this price point in Singapore (I’ve stayed in a fair number of them especially given I am a local)!",February 2024,40,1.0
Relaxing atmosphere and massage,Would recommend a treatment here. We stayed in the hotel however if you aren’t it would be a great way to enjoy marina sands.

The staff was very helpful and friendly for the duration too.",February 2024,4,5.0
Best affinity pool,Absaloutly loved staying in this hotel. Swimming in the affinity pool was top of my bucket list since 2010.

One night only if you must!,"We will certainly never stay here again. First impressions stick and MBS made a lasting impact with our arrival. 5 rows deep of taxi chaos out the front of tower 1 was a prelude. Our luggage was whisked away (more about this later) and we entered without a greeting. Looking up in the lobby is a marvel but at ground level totally inhuman. Packed, nowhere to sit and oddly walled off from the long spectacular space with high wall of a food outlet. Shockingly our next experience was a three row deep snaking queue to check in. Our wait was 50mins, standing. Trying to download and use their app to check in was fruitless as, on our phones, registration for an account didn’t work. Finally we got to our room (tower 3 a decent walk away) eager to head to the Gardens by the Bay nearby but another wait began for our luggage. We called about its whereabouts twice during our wait of 45mins and no one could tell us where is was or when we could expect it. Dinner: I mistakenly assumed that staying here we would be able to get a table for a meal. Every table was booked so no such luck. Fortunately as the crowded but incredible rooftop pool was a reason we wanted to stay, we could get a basic meal in our swimmers. Better communication before arriving could have helped on this point. Our experience of the MBS was epically impersonal, way finding was non existent (prepare to get lost and confused!) and an antiquated lack of sustainability practices topped off the experience.",March 2024,4,1.0
Amazing!!,It is an amazing place. There is so much to do but you will need at least 2 days to see the area. The gardens are beautiful along with the mall and don’t forget the hotel that has the roof top bar and if you stay at the hotel you get to enjoy the infinity pool overlooking the beautiful city.,January 2024,152,5.0
Professional service,"Visited the hotel for some drinks and what I really wanted to say most was the wonderful service provided by the staff. Saraswathy, Sazali, Maadesh and Nicholas were all so helpful and friendly, very very professional individuals. DJ at the front drive was also so helpful in trying to help me figure out how to use the grab app to book a ride home when my bank was under scheduled maintenance and did not allowed me to top up my grab wallet. These team members are truly an asset to the company. Thank you all.",March 2024,2,5.0
Great hotel,Amazing hotel in an ideal location! Staff went above and beyond. Check in was welcoming and had our room ready early for us which was very welcome after a long flight.

Always a perfect experience!,Always an amazing experience. Everyone is super professional and kind. The room is clean and the bathroom very luxurious. But the best are the massage beds.

So bad.... only stay if you deserve punishment,"If I ever have burning desire to:•	Pay for a highfloor harbour-view and receive a lower floor garden-view•	Listen to jackhammers and other refurbishment/construction noises ongoing from 09:00 onwards during my entire stay•	stay in an overrated room which has damages, shoddy completed repairs, and no toilet roll (I have pictures)•	stay in a dirty room with dust everywhere and rust stains on the lamps (I have pictures)•	miss out on Internet, TV and Telephone for more than half a day (unannounced and no updates)•	reregister my keycard again because the elevator no longer accepts my original keycard•	have breakfast at 6:30 because that’s what the advice is and when it is the only time it is not crazy busy•	stand in line for every possible restaurant or feature•	especially just ridiculously overpay for the experienceOnly then will I return to the MBS.I believe that hotel restaurants should cater for guests first and then for 3rd parties. To not be able to reserve a table for the next 2 days as a hotel resident is just absurd.I was promised unparalleled luxury matched by exceptional service and I got neither – I have travelled extensively in the world including to sunny Nigeria and other parts of Africa and this hotel for me was the biggest disappointment of all - I would rate the premises akin to a single star rating at very best.I did not enjoy every minute; in fact I did not even enjoy one single minute of my stay and ohh by the way…. it cost me a small fortune.This review was sent to MBS for comment but they decided to stay silent.",January 2024,1,1.0
Perfection!  Superb service and a million dollar location and view of Singapore,"We started our vacation in Singapore by staying here for 5 nights, and enjoyed every minute of it.  Yes, it is a large resort and very busy, but that is part of the glamour and excitement.  Our room was in Tower 3 on the 33rd floor overlooking the gardens.  We found the room to be very clean, spacious with modern amenities.  A ginormous flat screen TV.  The resort provided bottled water plus complimentary beverages in the small refrigerator.   Nice robes and slippers for our comfort and use during our stay.  Also gave us a big platter of fresh fruits upon arrival and mid stay.The view overlooking the garden was a bonus, as we enjoyed the light shows in the evening right from our room.  Facing the gardens also gave us sweeping view to the sea.  Part of our reasons for staying here is to use the stunning rooftop infinity pools on the 57th floor.  Nothing short of perfection.  The pool staff is elite, the food and beverages were superb, and we used the pool during the day as well as at sunset to maximize the amazing views.  To see the bright moon light up the sky filled with beautiful city lights was so special.The location of the resort is also great.  Just a walkway to the Gardens By the Bay, as well as to endless restaurants and shops.  Even a food court/center, filled with many great eats (in AC!).  The MRT is also located nearby.  We also used the gym a few times, although with quite a walk from our room.  We walked the pedestrian Helix bridge to reach the Singapore Flyer, as well did the short way over to Lau Pa Sat hawker food center.  We felt the city is very walkable, even went to the Merilion statue via the route around the waterfront.As for the resort staff, it is clear that they have extensive service training.  Special thanks to the front desk staff for smooth check-in and check-out process.  We especially enjoyed talking to Din and Adele at the Concierge desk, they were delightful and so helpful with our questions.With the highest rating of 5 stars, we really wanted to give the Marina Bay Sands 10!  Bravo!",February 2024,"1,679",5.0
Magicql Sound Healing with Kanu,"The sound healing with Karu was one of the most magical, heart opening experiences I have ever had… I was in awe, the perfect balance of peace, tranquility, beauty with sounds that literally moved the body….They say when the student is ready, the teacher will appear…. But in this case, i think the experience helped me to arrive in a place of openness - my  heart is full of compassion.",March 2024,1,5.0
