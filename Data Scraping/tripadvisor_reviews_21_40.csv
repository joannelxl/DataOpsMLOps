Once in a lifetime luxury,"I will never stay at a better hotel in my life. We had booked one night at MBS as part of our honeymoon, but we got upgraded to a Paiza suite. Holy shooting damn it was beautiful. I mean. Oh my god. Big. Luxurious. Perfect. With skyline views from 41st floor. Never will I ever stay at a better suite. 24 hour butler service. Jesus We only have positives thing to say. We just stayed in our room, we never wanted to leave. At 11 pm we looked at the city skyline from our bathtub. Our honeymoon peaked here. Thank you for that amazing experience!",August 2023,14,5.0
Amazing Birthday Stay at MBS,"My family spend a night at MBS for my wife’s birthday. In addition to the amazing room charges, Charmaine, John, Dyana and team service was Superstars. Despite some minor hiccups along the way, everything far exceeded our wildest expectations. Started with the exceptional room size, layout, views on both sides & outstanding comfort, complete with all birthday frills especially the lush bouquet and strawberry cake & champagne; followed by making full use of the 1 day plus stay (thru their kind courteous extension & complimentary valet parking) to go to the mall several times yesterday, had a long morning boardwalk walk, visited the Flower Dome and enjoyed a well reserved sumptuous buffet lunch at Rise. Once again, thanks a million MBS, Charmaine, John, Dyana & team. Cheers 👏👍🤩",May 2023,1,5.0

Lots of Awesomeness staying at the most iconic and the most instagrammed Marina Bays Sands Hotel:,"Fantastic location and did not disappoint 😊 Our room was on the 20th floor that offered a beautiful and spectacular panoramic view of the city, the Marina Bay and the famous Merlion. The room was equipped and stacked with things we needed. The infinity pool on the rooftop is a huge plus for sure. The view of Singapore from the infinity pool is beyond breath-taking. All the staff are incredibly friendly, efficient and obviously well trained.  Shout out to Din Mahamud in the Concierge department and Guest Service agent – Yancy for taking care of us. To the staff who did very well in cleaning and putting our room in order. Thank you all for a wonderful wonderful experience.  I hope to go back!",August 2023,66,5.0
Marina Bay Sands Fitness Centre,"Hi!Have a nice day for all.I would like to introduce to you all at Marina Bay Sands fitness centre.An inconspicuous corner,a place where few people pass by BUT once you get to this place,you will fall in love with him.Why?Sparrows are small,it has all internal organ.The sports equipment inside is very complete it makes people want to move involuntarily and more caring waiters,that is ROSEYN,UMA and AFFA. They are very loving and patient in teaching for everyone make people feel intimacy.Don’t forget to come to this place.",August 2023,2,5.0
Great Culture,"My wife and I decided to visit Singapore before our final destination, and it was an excellent choice. We saw the culture, mingled with the people, saw modern Asian architecture, experimented on food and all of the above were wonderful experiences. Shopping everywhere, their subway system are very easy to maneuver, taxi is easy access as well. Singapore, make sure that it’s in your bucket list.",February 2023,31,5.0
"Over priced, if your not a millionaire don’t go as your treated like your not important.","Prices are astronomical, get way more for your money elsewhere in the country with just as high standards. Can’t even get in any of the restaurants on site. Charge another 18% on top of already expensive room. Clear prioritise for more important guests. Pool and location only good bit.",August 2023,7,1.0

Happy staycay,"Stayed for 2N at MBS together with my 2 kids. Complimentary upgraded to Premier room. View from room was magnificent. Rook facilities were also nice, with 2 basins and bathtub.The next day morning, we had breakfast at The Rise, our fav restaurant which we patronised min 4 times a year. Overall we enjoyed our staycay very much.",February 2020,45,5.0
Excellent staycation made close-to-perfect,"From its signature infinity pool to the stunning architecture, this hotel takes the cake on many levels (pun unintended). With just a short air-conditioned stroll to MRT station, the whole Singapore is at your fingertips. The spacious hotel room was indeed a surprise- you can’t find any hotel room bigger than this in Singapore. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn’t do anything for birthday celebrations.",March 2020,33,5.0
An excellent service!,"The service of the staff was stellar. We had a lovely lunch time in one of the restaurants. It has a truly spectacular sight from one of the most beautiful hotels in the world, looking over part of one of our favorite cities.We only found a problem, and it is that they need to have more food with decent price to cater to the local. Also, to walk from one end to another end of the hotel. It is very far.",July 2021,1,5.0
"Comfortable, Decadent couple stay during Covid","We had a complimentary upgrade and my request for a quiet room was met as it was away from the elevator. The wait till check in was heavily regulated due to Covid but the service was fantastic. I signed up for an MBS membership that same day too. The room was very classy, clean and had a great view of the Gardens by the bay. We booked our pool slot in advance and loved the view from the top too. Despite the ever-changing measures for Covid (we could not dine in at that time), I had to order food as takeaway from restaurants. The food was packed well and I made sure to order it before the dinner crowd arrived. Some of the entrances and exits were a bit confusing though. Having the MBS membership is a plus because it applies to all shops and restaurants in the shoppes and hotel. Would definitely stay again for the air-conditioned  atmosphere (everything is interconnected apart from the gardens) and privacy.",June 2021,30,5.0
Renovated rooms are amazing,"I stayed at MBS pre-pandemic and was rather disappointed with the guest rooms, they were extremely basic, more 3 Star than 5 Star, not worth the money. Heading back to Singapore I stayed in one of their renovated rooms and I was truly amazed by the transformation. The renovated rooms are top luxury, lots of accessories, a mini bar out of this world, they can finally compete with the best of the best.",October 2022,"2,030",5.0
Wonderful stay at MBS,"Would like to give a thumbs up to the services provided at MBS. Got an upgrade to Orchid suite for staying over during our wedding weekend. A super pleasant surprise. Check in was done at Sands Lounge- Renee who was serving us at the lounge was super patient and friendly explaining to us the perks. Then when we went up to the room, we were so impressed by the view we had! We could see the gardens and the harbour directly below us. The room had a small balcony that is sufficient for us to stand and chill with the breeze. The bathroom came with a super spacious vanity room with a bath tub too! Special thanks for Sean Liaw for all this arrangement, including a bottle of champagne and some mini chocolates... again small touch that goes a long way.... Breakfast was delicious at RISE, which we didn’t have to wait too long as were down at around 830am. Subsequently after 9 am there was a long queue forming up already.  The pool - just one tip- please book once you are given the link if not you will not stand a chance to do so. Do not pick 6am or any night slots if you are someone who hates cold water and chill wind. Will spend the remaining of the day chilling with a book in the room to enjoy our day! Thank you for MBS for giving us such a memorable honeymoon stay! Will comeback again!",December 2021,5,5.0
Services with smiles,"From the start to the finish, John and Andre from the Premium Service team, show an immense courtesy, professionalism and knowledge of Singapore and its wonderful attractions. We were met at the airport by an assistant who took us through passport control who without her knowledge, we would have found it’s difficult to answer all the questions to gain entry to the country. They made one kind gesture sending us a complimentary Singapore Sling. The whole team from Premium Service team should be congratulated for the representation of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.",April 2023,18,5.0
Fantastic Pool Experience,Splendid panoramic view of the Swimming pool. Staffs there are warm and friendly esp lifeguard Kelvin Chua he is very attentive and helpful in leading and directing us to our designated pool area.

Fantastic!,"My friend and I had booked a stay at MBS during November (Covid SSM still in place). Shirley checked us in on the desk and organised a special room for us. We were taken to our room - the veiw across the city was brilliant. The room was tidy and clean. The bathroom and bath tub were excellent. We booked a pool slot for the day time and lifeguard Moe was very friendly and helpful. We were able to book an evening slot for the pool too (really recommend doing this if you can) and Leo was the pool attendant at night. Again very helpful and friendly. Other mentions for excellent staff: Kate and Camille and Zack. Overall, a brilliant stay with excellent staff. Thank you!",November 2021,8,5.0
Famous landmark and pool,"Staying here for 2 weeks. Maybe due to tower 2 closed for renovations, the hotel is near full occupancy. Couldn’t book a suite and settled for a room with “garden” view. The garden is the supertree grove so pretty cool. Got a low 12th floor so pretty disappintedThe porter is helpful, the front desk pretty grumpy. The rest of the staff from housekeeping to operators to gym/pool staff are thankfully as pleasant as the porterThe room is ok sized with a generous balcony and 50-60 inch flat screen tv. The bed is disapponting - not king sized nor luxurious. Towels too, are worn and cheap feeling. So no 5 star luxury feels hereBecause the hotel is huge with 3 towers, it is extra exercise walking to the gym and pool. The gym is large and ok. The world famous pool is always crowded as expected, but nice since it’s 57 stories upFor convenience, the shopping mall is connected and you can literally get and eat anything thereWrote seperate reviews for the hotel restaurants 7/10",June 2022,"26,690",4.0

Amazing premium service from MBS,"We had an amazing bday celebration for our mothers. We booked 3 beautiful rooms. MBS Premium service was amazing. No need to queue for registration. Registration and payment can be done inside the room. The newly renovated rooms are better than the rooms we booked previously. The staff are also more hospitable now, a lot of Filipino staffs were also there to assist us from the moment we arrived and assisted us until departure. The service has really improved a lot! We will definitely recommend to our friends and family who will visit Singapore.",November 2023,2,5.0
Amazing,Amazing.All the pictures you see are true.Forbes voted it one of the best hotels In the world!Great views over the city from the pool.Hospitality is second to none and nothing is too much trouble.Great shopping mall underneath and the hotel as @60 restaurant to choose from,November 2023,161,5.0
Excellent Location and a Great View,Excellent location and a great view.  There is a MRT just outside tower 1 and it’s a short walk to the Gardens by the Bay. If you want to splurge go for the Premier City View rooms on floors 32 and above. If you stay in tower 1 you can take an elevator directly to the famous infinity pool on the roof but if you stay in either of the other two towers you’ll have to take two elevators up to the pool. Even if you stay in the less expensive rooms you still get to use the pool and other guest only areas and you can always enjoy the view from the roof.,November 2023,178,5.0

Best hotel in Singapore,"We throughly enjoyed our Marina Bay Sands and if you are in Singapore and thinking of staying here DO IT it is worth every penny! A huuuge thank you to the kind gentleman who checked us in we think his name was Arty or Andy as he upgraded our room to one of the newly renovated premier rooms free of charge which made our stay even more special, the premier rooms are luxurious and have everything you could need along with a stunning view of the gardens.The hotel facilities especially the rooftop infinity pool and sky observation deck (which you can visit as many times as you want) are amazing you can continue to use the facilities once you have checked out which is an added bonus. The breakfast has soo much choice and we had dinner at the Lavo restaurant which was fantastic. We would definitely stay at MBS and highly recommend spending that little bit extra for their premier rooms. Thank you to everyone for a fantastic stay.",October 2023,3,5.0
Cleanest and tidiest room I’ve ever stayed in.,"Stayed at Tower 1 for 6 nights. Very comfortable and clean rooms. Spacious and newly renovated. Room service was 5 stars.

An experience to repeat.",November 2023,27,5.0
Worth it. Do it,Amazing hotel. Obviously the infinity pool delivers but what was most amazing was they kept the whole experience friendly and personal.

What a view!,"This hotel is out of this world! Benjamin on reception checked us in and was absolutely charming and we were upgraded as it was for a special birthday. Friendly, welcoming service. Room was gorgeous - even had its own cocktail cabinet! Of course the highlight is the skypark on the roof where the views are absolutely fabulous. You don't even need to bring your own suncream as it's provided. A drink in the skypark's bar  is a must for the evening as it's truly stunning when the city is lit up as well as the Gardens by the bay. Well worth the money.",November 2023,13,5.0
Best Staycation,"It was a staycation plan for my mom's birthday celebration. A wonderful experience with the room, the facilities, premises accessibility, the pool, the food and service team from MBS. It was far more surpass our expectations.

Great premium service,"Stayed at city view suite with my mom. Great view, comfortable bed, high quality facilities & amenities. Look for Daniel Tuong & the premium service team. They are excellent with a lot of attention to details & very customer focus.  For us, the service is the highlight besides the view. Giving this experience a 4 not a 5 as it’s really a hassle to park the car. It’s far from the hotel  lobby & it’s always full.

What an amazing experience,"What an amazing experience we had staying at Marina Bay Sands. From the moment we got out of the taxi and were met by Ian who was so friendly and helpful, we knew we were in for a treat.  At the reception desk, we were served by Ruchelle. She greated us with kindness and warmth and ensured the kids were spoilt. We were only staying one night, as a treat for our daughters birthday, and when Ruchelle found that out, we were upgraded to a VIP suite.

Amazing Hospitality Service,"Went for a staycation for two nights at Marina Bay Sands for a quick getaway to recharge after a long week. The suite was spacious with an amazing layout and a soft bed with crisp sheets. All the meals were really scrumptious with a lot of options to choose from. Particularly had a nice dinner at Wakuda and the Wagyu Yaki Udon exceeded my expectations, along with the Ora King Salmon Maki. Food came really quickly and staff had an excellent service attitude. The stay was made pleasant by the service of two butlers, Danial and Ronnie. They were fast and efficient, and very attentive to detail. Nothing was too much trouble for them, and they went out of their way to assist with all the requests to ensure that my stay was comfortable. With a glance, you can tell that they are very passionate about their job. Their service went beyond my expectations and it was everything I can wish for.

Excellent Hospitality,"I’m  writing to express our sincere appreciation for the wonderful experience we had during our recent stay at MBS Hotel. From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the warm welcome and excellent service provided by your staff.The complimentary room upgrade that we received during our stay from Mr Shawn, the Executive Director,  was absolutely stunning, and we were thrilled to have the opportunity to experience such luxurious accommodations. The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed, with all the amenities we needed for a comfortable stay.What impressed us the most, however, was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff. They were always friendly, courteous, and went out of their way to ensure that our stay was enjoyable. I must say that our experience at MBS hotel was truly exceptional. The room upgrade made our stay  even more incredible and it added this once-in-a-lifetime experience for my husband,  together with our young kids on my husband’s birthday.  I would like to commend the staff for their outstanding service and thank you for creating such a welcoming and comfortable environment for your guests.Please feel free to share my feedback with your team, and I look forward to staying at MBS hotel again in the future.",November 2023,2,5.0

"Convenient and very nice rooms, but not the best value for $$$","Mixed feelings. It's very convenient and comfortable, but also not the best value for the amount of money. I also didn't like that I felt that the hotel tried to upsell me at check-in for the same room.",November 2023,4,4.0
Fantasy  Rules!!!,"The place is enormous! Everything is very grand. It's pricey as you would expect but it's a world unto itself. The pool is such a delightful time but make sure you go early or during check out time to get a lounge by the pool. The views can not be described you have to see it to believe it. We stayed in Tower 3 but all towers have amazing views. What we didn't like were some rules they had about what shoes men could wear to the restaurant by the pool. Men can not wear sandals, even expensive ones but the ladies could. And this was just to get a drink. The hostess was not very gracious in explaining this to us and she was difficult to understand. It left a bad first impression on us as we just arrived. What saved this visit were the light and water shows, the views, beautiful rooms and the wonderful concierge Din. He spent so much time planing our time there and made every effort to make our stay fun and found the kind of places we were most interested in. The mall attached to the hotel is also a maze of shops and food court. The food there is just OK, better to go to China Town. I don't recommend Little India for a visit. It felt unsafe (saw a drug deal right in front of us) and very dirty. Stay around the hotel where there are many food options. It's quite the experience.",October 2023,218,4.0
Not the exclusive experience we where  expecting.,"Not Sophisticated a bit on par with a premier Inn The room is very basic the bathrobes poor quality and poorly pressed. The toiletries not very good quality. The best thing was the huge TV  only there was nothing to watch no Netflix and no Amazon. The Front foyer was nothing short of madness you couldn’t distinguish between guests and the public everybody taking pictures and selfies for there social media.Ever type of poorly dressed flip flop local you could imagine. The selling point is the pool that’s if you can get into it, the water was to warm not refreshing at all 100s of social Medea ’ fools taking 100s of selfies in all kinds of poses you can imagine.  Most people seem to stay only one or two nights and leave. Such a shame for such a beautiful iconic building. Without the madness in the foyer and with a little control it could be improved  some people entered the lift without room keycards to see if they could gain scoot the upper floors and the pool area the security was so Poor.Hotel management not visible anywhere the staff are delightful and helpful at all times. But we will never go back despite its position. Next time it’s the Fullerton Hotel for us. More genteel more sophisticated better value.",September 2023,571,3.0
Magnificent.,One of the most iconic hotels in the world and very majestic indeed. The amenities and comfort of this hotel is unmatched anywhere i have stayed. The infinity pool is the must and it is breathtaking view is unparalleled.,July 2023,22,5.0
"A pride to stay at MBS, but be polite at restaurants please","Good room - what you'd expect, clean and functions very well. Sound proof. The pool was a great facility , albeit a bit cramped , you forgive this for the vibe and fun feeling.We really liked the hotel experience - shoppe, casino, several restaurants and bars and most team members were friendly and helpful We were disappointed with some of the dining experience - some staff and overall service were spikey and it was sometimes slow making it really poor value, given the food was good (but not outstanding). We did feedback a couple of examples when we were at the hotel, but it seemed to continue and was a little bitter taste for an overall great stay. We felt great coming back to MBS when out and about , a sense of pride in some ways.",October 2023,131,4.0
Pricey but worth it!!,"Our hotel experience made our Singapore visit a trip we’ll always remember. We stayed for 2 nights, and there were so many things to do in and around the hotel grounds for free. Super trees (don’t miss the light show), the Skypark, the Spectra sound and light show in front of the bay, and the rooftop infinity pool was amazing. And all the hotel location made it very easy to see the big sites of Singapore and come back to the hotel to rest from the heat when needed. The hotel staff made us feel like royalty: Joan was so helpful with activity & meal recommendations, Roselyn was so amazingly accommodating and professional at the fitness center (and Uma, too!), and our bellman, Yezar, was very impressive during checkout making sure we had our many bags taken down on time and ready for our transport. Amazing experience that everyone should enjoy at least once in their life!  So glad we stayed at the MBS!",October 2023,6,5.0

Wonderful Stay at Marina Bay,"Top-notch luxury hotel in Singapore!! The rooms and bathroom were very large, luxurious and comfortable. Our room stylist was extremely friendly and gave us additional amenities!! I would like to mention that the check in time was 3pm, but the staff were very kind and let us get our room as soon as possible. And allowed us to check out a bit late. The infinity pool was very fancy, we went there during daylight because it the weather was hot, and at night time for pictures with the amazing city view.Slightly disappointing that we got the city view instead of the garden view (we will look forward the next time we stay at Marina Bay to get a garden view room). I also noticed that when we turned on the security chain on the door, and tested it by trying to open the door, the chain fell off, reducing the levels of security (although Singapore is very safe). Given the price of one night it would’ve been better if we got a breakfast included.",September 2023,5,4.0
Sweet Escapade at Marina Bay Sands,"The moment we entered in our room, we were welcomed with nice complimentary treats and had a quick tour on what to expect. We were delighted with how elegant and spacious the room was. We certainly had a stunning view from our room seeing both the Art Museum / Helix Bridge! It was above and beyond our expectation as the hotel was equipped with Salvatore Ferragamo and all other essentials were provided. The hotel is indeed surrounded with beautiful attractions and was an easy access. Everything were nearby our hotel: Gardens By the Bay, MBS shopping mall, Marquee and Casino (prepare to walk a lot). THE INFINITY POOLIt was a lovely morning when we head to Infinity Pool and had nice breakfast at Spago. When one of the crew found out it was my birthday, I was surprised with mocktails and danced while serving. It doesn’t stop there, right when we got back to our room, I was surprised with a birthday cake! So much gratitude to the Infinity Pool Crew Christy and Dennis for making this one of the most unforgettable moment I have ever experienced and made my stay in Marina Bay Sands spectacular.",September 2023,2,5.0

One of those “Must Stays” that lives up to Hype!,"So, this is one of those “must stay” hotels that actually lives up to the hype. From the time we arrived in our taxi till checkout we were impressed with the staffs attention to our needs even though it’s busy all day long. The staff were pleasant and rooms clean. Even when they check your room key prior to access to the roof pool, it was painless but effective. Getting restaurant reservations when it shows booked online was also a plus. The location is of course top notch. I’m not sure I would need to stay more than a few days, but the two nights we did stay were fantastic.",November 2023,323,5.0

We especially want to thank Ms Glaiza Gonzales for making our stay a memorable one, especially for our son, who is an architecture enthusiast and aspires to become an architect.

Disappointing but still worth it for the iconic  pool experience,"Honestly, we were pretty disappointed with our stay here. We booked it as a finalHurrah after a week in Singapore then a week Bintan island which were simply amazing. The first problem was nearly an hour checking in. Huge queues, it felt more like airport check in than a five star hotel. Compare this to where we stayed in Indonesia when you get ushered to a comfy sofa, given aCold face towel and welcome drink whilst they efficiently sort out your documents etc.Marina Bay, ages standing, nowhere to sit, noisy. At check in they just seems to be endlessly tapping on the keyboard. Despite it being 6pm the rooms weren’t ready and we therefore missed our dinner reservation. When we got to the room there was no bed for our son. We were told he was expected to share the bed with us. A 9 year old with additional needs, he has to have his own bed. I then had to argue about an additional charge for a bed (bearing in mind you have paid £500+ for the room for one night. They eventually madding‘Complimentary’. After complaining, we were allowed a late check out. So, we went to the pool. Then came down to find the key had been disabled. Had to queue again in reception in wet swimming stuff to get the key sorted. Then another very lengthy checkout process, 45 mins again.‘I just don’t know why it takes so long. The Premier Inn is better! The rooms themselves are nothing special either.Carpets seemed musty and decor uninspiring.Ok. Well now for the positives, as you can see from misting my reviews we are very positive people 😄. The pool area really is beautiful, and a chance for amazing pictures.All staff were friendly throughout. Conclusion- mass tourism not for us.",August 2023,211,3.0
Exceptional,"The hotel itself is amazing and the rooms are fabulous but the main feature are the staff! We arrived from our flight at 8.00am and the wonderful receptionist found us our room which was already made up so we could check in immediately. The real star was the guest relations man, Din, who went above and beyond in helping us organise our brief time in Singapore. From advising us on attractions to booking tickets and organising our luggage for us he couldn’t have been more helpful and friendly. A big ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ to him.

Singapore's Best Hotel!,"Marina Bay Sands is a hotel where luxury and quality meet. This hotel has become a symbol of Singapore, a small yet vibrant country. You must definitely stay at this hotel, which is compact but offers a lot. Especially in terms of hygiene, it's extremely satisfying. As a recommendation, make sure to use the infinity pool at the very top.

August 2023,"Pros. The staff were the most attentive, friendly and helpful people I have ever met whilst staying in a hotel. Nothing was too much trouble, they were genuinely interested in our well-being and any request was done at lightening speed. Everyone (bar tenders, room service, waiters ect) were all so welcoming and happy. Considering the size of the hotel, I was pleasantly suprised that we got the type of personalised service you would expect in a small,boutique hotel. When arriving, I would recommend using the app check-in to avoid the airport length queues. The room was clean and the toiletries included were designer. We ate at the Spago restaurant which overlooked the pool (we requested an outdoor table) and the service and food was exquisite. Probably one of the best meals I have ever experienced. Although the area around the pool was busy, the pool never felt busy so there was plenty of room to swim and to take those all important selfies! Cons. The bed and pillows were as hard as nails and it resulted in me getting hip pain for the following day. Although extremely spacious, the room was dated and very beige. It didn't look as 'sparkly' as it did in the pictures on the website. The majority of the restaurants which are advertised on the hotel's website are situated in the shopping mall so double check locations when booking. The outdoor pool is busy and beds go fast! We had to use two beds which were located in the water so there was no dry land around us to rest drinks on etc.  When leaving, we got a taxi outside the hotel and it cost us $60 but had we booked it ourselves it would have costs $35 for the same journey.",August 2023,14,4.0
Incredible but you need deep pockets,"Stayed for one night on the way back to England and the place is breathtaking in scale, architecture, ambition, the list goes on.  We booked the cheapest room which was still something like £650 a night and were told they didn’t have a high floor room as requested but could offer a comp upgrade to a suite but be aware it’s near where they are doing renovations and there would be some noise in the daytime which didn’t matter to us as we would be out.  The suite was breathtaking - bigger than the upstairs in my house, massive dining / living room, separate pool room / bar, massive double balcony, the list goes on.  We were on the 51st floor with amazing views and only 6 floors from the rooftop pool which was obviously amazing.  It’s busy up there but lots of loungers and generally a really special place to be.  We ate at Ce La Vie the rooftop restaurant which fitted my general observations that high up restaurants are generally overpriced and not amazing food - dinner for 2 adults and 1 child with a single bottle of wine was £330 and absolutely unremarkable.  Breakfast at the rooftop Italian restaurant was great though.  Location is obv great - walking distance to the Gardens and Avatar thing and all the shops.  This is a must stay location - if you can afford it !",August 2023,88,5.0
Amazing pool & average service,"It started with a long wait at arrivals desk as we noted that the price to pay shown was over 50% more than the reservation rate we were given at time of booking. Eventually sorted, no apology other than an explanation it was a computer issue. Room request for connected or adjacent rooms not met, not only that but one of our rooms wasn’t ready, after a very long flight this was also very frustrating. Rooms were nice and clean and the view over the gardens was lovely. The view from the pool is outstanding and in my opinion is the only reason to book this hotel. Staff were courteous but there were too many people everywhere and the level of service was not as expected for the price range.",July 2023,3,3.0

Still nice and beautiful but the price point is starting to be too high for what you get...,"This was likely my 4th or 5th time staying at this hotel and the views never disappoint.  The brunch at Rise restaurant is also always special.  However, at this price point it's starting to get hard for me to justify the stay.  At approx $700 USD+ a night it was double what I've paid in the past.  I didn't see much to justify.  The minibar that I could enjoy (without charge) was quite bare with plain potato chips, an ""oriental cracker"" snack and some juices all full of sugar.  When they mentioned we could enjoy the minibar at no additional charge when we checked in I thought about past places like ""Upper House"" in Hong Kong that had free nicely stocked mini-bars.  This one at MBS paled in comparison.  The bath products are slightly better than what they had before but still not as nice as those I used at the JW Marriott earlier in the week (significantly cheaper price point).  I think going forward I might limit the nights I stay as 3 nights at this price point just was not worth it.  Breakfast should have definitely been included.  Another odd thing I noticed is that the entire check in team all wore ""in training"" buttons.  I wonder why they are constantly turning over staff so much.  It's a huge place and not very personal. While at the pool someone did walk around offering iced grapes which was refreshing.  This reminded me of pools in Miami but in Miami they offer more...  The views never get old and are among the best in Singapore.  If I'm forced to end with something positive, I do like that they extended the hours of the pool to midnight.",November 2023,40,5.0

Checked in to room with used items left behind by previous guests,"Couldn't find any channel to provide our feedback. Check-in was fast and the lady provided us with all the information needed. Upon check-in, we were told that our room given was newly renovated and held high expectations for it. The room given looked very modern, new and brightly lit, only to notice in the evening that there's used cotton bud left behind uncleaned and when we return from dinner, we noticed that there's pieces of used tissues found on the sofa behind the cushion, which left us in disgust. Cleanliness these days are the utmost important factor, so to have items that are used, left behind by previous guest (or god knows how many guests before you) is totally unacceptable.This just goes to show that the bed board was not clean and dusted, neither areas of the rooms cleaned and inspected prior to giving out to guests at check in. With rising cases of COVID in Singapore, we thought hotels would ensure that their cleanliness is tip-top but this was not in our case. Despite the points raised above, the services we received from the hotel staff were still commendable.Just a note, we stayed in Tower 2 , room 1073 from 07 Dec - 08 Dec '23. With this review, we just hope this will alert the hotel in ensuring all rooms are thoroughly cleaned prior to every guests' arrival.",December 2023,81,2.0

If you are really lucky they will offer you outside under the flyover with no shade, a delight, we opted to stay inside for our 2nd breakfast.Eggs took an age and boiled eggs were cold. Juice was watered down.The room we upgraded for a view over the gardens which was beautiful but on reflection was it worth the extra money probably not, but it was nice to have a balcony. Bed was like a brick if we had been staying longer than 2 nights I would have asked for it to be changed. It was a bucket list ambition glad I've done it but unless you have very deep pockets and we saved hard to afford the 2 nights we had think carefully before you go we got into the pool 1 time due to the weather.Glad to have done it tho.",November 2023,68,3.0

Lovely but……,"I don’t want to sound ungrateful or picky as this IS a lovely hotel. The staff are incredibly nice and it is a destination experience but is it 5 star and is it the best I have stayed? Honestly no, we did all the pre-booking registration via the app as requested. I found the App difficult, clunky and constantly logging me out. Time to book in and the App was down. Luckily we were usher to one side and the old fashioned check in commenced. Nice room, clean but a non renovated one and a bit tired. It was my husband milestone birthday and a lovely cake was waiting in the room for us. During a few days at MBS we tried room service (breakfast and dinner) buffet lunch & breakfast, drinks & snacks at the pool and a few of the restaurants in the mall. All fantastic- not a bad meal anywhere and always lovely service but nothing personal. Other than a piece of cake on our first day, which wasn’t his actual birthday during the stay there was nothing. We had to ask for room to be made up, drinks in mini bar to refill and amenities. Once we checked in, that was it. Very underwhelming. Bit of a shock after we flew home to find the full bill for the stay removed from the credit card while the “hold fee” which was also the full stay rates and the deposit had been removed from our credit card. Several emails with NO reply at all and the money was returned 2 weeks after leaving Singapore. Beautiful hotel? yes, lovely and pleasant service when they are in front of you? yes, spectacular views and stunning hotel? yes, yes, yes. Am I being picky or unrealistic? I don’t think so,  Being forced to use the App which isn’t the best, having to ask for basic amenities to be restocked during multi day stay, having no personal touches during a milestone and then having billing inquiries not responded too is not comparable to any other 5 star hotel I have enjoyed. I would certainly recommend a night as a bucket list adventure, pay the big dollars to experience the pool and hotel.However as a multi day stay in my experience had no benefits, once you were checked in, that was it. Even checking out was just putting the room key in a mailbox type slot and being pointed to the taxi rank. Never had that type of “greet then forget/ignore” type of service from a 5 star hotel before.",October 2023,225,4.0
Yet another pleasant and enjoyable stay at MBS,"This is yet another year we booked ourselves a stay with MBS to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We must say their services have again lived up to our expectations.

Their service staff and reception staff are very cheerful and respectful and kept checking on us if we needed help with anything. A pleasant incident we experienced at RISE restaurant for our breakfast where their staff (upon seeing us with young kids) offered their help with our food have shown their professional hospitality attitude.The room we had is fabulous - clean and neat, spacious with a very mesmerising city view.. it was so comfortable that our kids refused to leave the room... On top of the excellent service by their staff and great hotel facilities, the proximity and accessibility to sightseeing spots, transportation and shopping cetainly made MBS a very good choice of stay.",November 2023,2,5.0
Luxury incarnate !,"MBS was one of the most luxurious properties we have visited. MBS never ceased to delight me and my 13 year old daughter, with its food ,ambience, service quality....It was an amazing stay! It was a very smooth visit right from the check in to check out!",November 2023,4,5.0
Revisit to MBS,"Pillow is a little too hard at our T3 room. Visited the new gym now located at L3 convention hall. No longer at Level 63. View is no longer as wow as before.2 very attentive staff at the gym, being served by Uma and Roselyn. Customer obsessed service. 2 thumbs up!!",November 2023,73,5.0
Amazing experience,"Our experience at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel was out of this world.It was my husbands 60th birthday and they upgraded our room to a Premier Suite with a city view from the room we had booked.The suite was incredible, never seen anything like it.We were shown to our room by the guest relations lady called Honey who was amazing, she explained every little detail of the room and how everything worked. Honey was so efficient, friendly and welcoming.The hotel arranged for a bottle of wine, chocolates and birthday cake to be delivered to the room which was a beautiful experience.Nothing was too much trouble and Honey kept in contact with us during the stay, making sure everything was ok.Everyone should have an experience at this hotel.",October 2023,3,5.0
Superb hotel,"Overall feedback, the hotel is very good in every aspects. I.e : clean room, good customer service, wide spread food choice and great hospitality.

It's all about the pool!,"Was expecting great things from this hotel.Had wanted to stay here since hearing about it's reputation and from people who've stayed here.Our room whilst nicely appointed and had a stunning view over the city was I thought a little underwhelming for the price (we paid about $AUD 860) and didn't include breakfast.If you stood at the end of the corridor next to our room you could have another great view so dragging a chair out there is a good idea.A large part of it's appeal is THE (rooftop) pool!  I had to experience this as it's well promoted and didn't disappoint.  There were plenty of people taking advantage of it at the time but it wasn't crowded which was great.  The views over the city are stunning but it was lightly raining that day and was ""freezing""!  About 19/20 oC!  I was still going to enjoy it though.  There are some shops up there but I didn't have a good look at them and think that they were just bars/cafes.  They had lifeguards that were in the water constantly presumably so that if they have to ""rescue"" someone they can do so quickly.   Easily spotted by their wetsuits.At the ground level there were a lot of shops and restaurants but also had an escalator that took you to the shopping centre across the road.  Allow plenty of time to get around it as there's a number of floors and the food court alone was a 15-min walk.Great place to stay.  Would do so again.",March 2023,6,5.0
Short Luxury Stay,"We spent 3 nights at the MBS on the way home from Thailand. Nice newly renovated room on a high floor with Garden views.The room was a good size and well appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable. The balcony had great sunrise views over the water, but you could also see the supers grove and watch the nightly lightshow(and even hear the music that it was set to).Staff were very friendly and helpful.The pool has fantastic views and there were water and sunscreen stations. I personally found the pool area too crowded, as this is a bucket list item for a lot of people so lots of people in the pool taking photos..it was even more crowded on the weekend. Even at 10pm there were lots of people in the pool. It is a great experience though and the staff always managed to find is deck chairs even when it was busy.We are at Bread Street in the Shoppes and also Spagos on the Skygarden level. Both different, but great food and service. We also had room service breakfast one morning, which is a great experience not to be missed.I used the gym every morning. Good gym, staffed and usually busy at 7:30am but had everything you need.Minor issues, but in our opinion the drains smelt, even on level 39. The smell seemed too come from the floor drain in the toilet and also in the shower. It also took a long time for the hot water to heat up in shower and sink. Minor gripes but people could find the drain smell off-putting.We’ve stayed in lots of hotels in Singapore over the years but this was the most luxurious, but be prepared to pay big $$$ for it.Well located on top of Bayview station to get around.If you want a luxury stay and are prepared to pay for it, this place is highly recommended.",October 2023,298,5.0
"Marina Bay Sands, a place well worthy of your bucket list","It was 2010 when I first visited MBS. Since then, our family always visits Singapore at least twice a year and stays at the same hotel. Thank you for remembering us after all these years. Every stay at your property has been superb. But our most recent stay was out of this world! We particularly appreciated the extra-attentive treatment as we were introducing our friends to stay with MBS for the very 1st time. This started with the complimentary limousine pick-up service the moment we landed at the airport; followed by being greeted at the hotel by the guest relation ambassador, Pauline Alcazar who guided us through the in-room check-in service. Our friends loved, above all, the rooftop infinity pool, where our kids spent hours enjoying the sun and the poolside snacks. (Please try out the chocolate chip cookies!)Our newly renovated room was located in Tower 2, mid-floor. Loved it! Absolutely the best angle to watch the 8pm lightshow! And even though it was a short 3d2n stay, our kids took so much advantage of the in-room dining and walking across to the main shopping mall. On our last day, guest service gave us an extended checkout time so that the kids could enjoy an afternoon swim before we headed to the airport. The amazing guest service crew, Honey Casquejo arranged a limousine to drop us off at T4. Everything at MBS, including the staff (especially Michael Lee who leads the Concierge and Guest Services) once again created unforgettable memories for me, my family and now also my friends, who have already started planning their next trip to MBS.",September 2023,6,5.0
If you don’t spend your money on Marina Bay Sands your children and grandchildren will so just do it.,This building has become the icon of Singapore for good reason. We stayed 2 nights as a end of holiday treat. Check in was busy but easy.  We got a level 33 room with stunning views over the gardens and out to sea across to Batam. Well worth spending the extra for the room. It was big and very well appointed. All the staff are courteous and helpful. The pool on the roof is amazing but does get crowded. I found early morning swim best to avoid all the instagram wannabe models posing for photos but each to their own . Personally I wanted to enjoy it for myself rather than convincing the rest of the world how much of a good time I was having. But yes I have to admit to taking a selfie by the edge of the infinity pool. We had the breakfast buffet on the roof top which was up there with the best of them. All the choices you could ever want. The area around the hotel is good with plenty of attractions within walking distance.Yes it was the most expensive hotel room I have ever booked but yes it was good and yes I would recommend that you do too.,October 2023,66,5.0

You pay a lot but you also get an amazing experience (especially in the new refurbished rooms)!!,"The hotel is an icon and you really have to pay a fortune for a simple room but if you arrive and you are so extreme nicely treated at check-in by a lovely receptionist who really understood that the visit for us was extra special no one thinks about the money anymore. Just a once in a life time experience. The new refurbished rooms are really, really amazing",May 2023,437,5.0
Excellent as expected,"The hotel view, facilities, and comfortable beds are worth the price!My family and I decided to stay at the Marina Bay Sand Hotel as we would visit our favorite place, Garden By The Bay. As expected, they have excellent service and facilities. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful from pre-arrival to checking out. I also had a good stay and rest in the hotel. However, the most memorable highlight was the breakfast. I chose Spago & Bar at Level 57, where I met Shahran, Aniel, and Jello. I shared that I had food allergies. They attentively helped me choose the menu and ensured all family members enjoyed breakfast. I also told them that I needed good coffee to start my day. Surprisingly, the guys also told me they could make us cups of good. It was the perfect delicious coffee! They selected good coffee beans, and the staff had the proper technique!  My family and I still talked about this experience at home. Ultimately, I drank 3-4 cups of coffee and chatted with them, and they (and the coffee) made our day! The restaurant reception staff was strict, so I didn't expect to meet these helpful and warm guys. The food was lovely, as expected, but I doubt I would meet the attentive, courteous, and friendly service experience in other places in Singapore.",April 2023,32,5.0
Best experience we ever had with Marina Bay Sands,"My husband and I had our wedding at MBS and we have got to say it is the best decision to host our wedding at MBS. From the start of choosing location for our wedding and the in charge for us was Ms Rachel Ho who was literally one of the best that have been liaising with us with everything regards to our wedding. She was the sweetest and most patient person I have ever met and really want to thank her for assisting us with it as it was really not easy managing everything and we cannot thank her enough for everything that she has done for us! We are so thankful and lucky to have her for helping us!Next we would love to thank the premium service team especially Mr John and Mr Daniel Tuang for the exceptional and outstanding service!Assisting us even before the actual wedding day itself! 1 day before the wedding they gave us a call and checked with us with regards to our programmed flow after our wedding, if we required assistance, if we required any parking car service for our personal vehicle as well as give us a run down of what to expect after the wedding which is something that I personally really appreciate, as I love to have things planned and known beforehand and them making that call gave me a lot of reassurance.On the day itself Mr John and Mr Daniel Tuang assisted us with checking in of our rooms as well as the checking in of the additional rooms we have booked for our families which personally i felt that it was really sweet of them to do that for us. Not to forget the smooth procedure of getting our items and having them to be brought up to our rooms. During the 2 night stay they were excellent, checking in on us and making sure that we are so well taken care of that it made us want to come back again to experience the immaculate service that was provided to us!  I cant express enough how excellent and great the service is except that Mr John, Mr Daniel Tuang and the premium service team really live up to the expectations of the world class image that people have of Marina Bay Sands. They are indeed a great asset to Marina Bay Sands and my husband and I would like to say thank the team for the excellent service down to even on the last touch point  which is the check out day itself.Mr Daniel Tuang personally came to assist us with the check out and not to forget about helping us to get a vehicle service to send us back home. That was really a lovely touch at the end of the whole stay as that personal touch jsut shows how much detailed and personal service the team has for their guest! Would definitely recommend to people the excellent service given by the premium service team.",September 2023,3,5.0
"""MUST DO"" when you visit Singapore.","My Sister and me stayed on Mid August 2023 in the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore.We visited Singapore 20 years ago, and we wanted to see what changed.And it was changed. A LOT. And from the BEST to THE VERY BEST.It’s no wonder why the Marina Bay Sands became one of the symbols of Singapore.After being in The Shangri-La Singapore (to be next to Orchard Road) we headed to the south of the city, and stayed for two days in the Marina Bay Sands, AND ITS IN ANOTHER LEVEL.The hotel is spectacular, and from the moment that we arrived everything went smoothly, efficiently and with a smile.We got our room with the City View, and ITS BREATH TAKING.The room was pure luxury. Spacious and equipped with all the modern comforts you could wish for, with a HUGE Smart Samsung 4K TV screen, with lot of channels and connectivity options.The bathroom is very spacious, with all the ordinary bathroom amenities, like tooth brush, tooth paste, etc. but in an enlarged sized and branded for the Marina Bay.The rooftop pool - the Infinity Pool - offers a breathtaking panoramic view of Singapore's skyline, and is a MUST DO when you're a guest in the hotel.Breakfast at the RISE restaurant is a delight. SPECTACULAR and has many options for every taste. Just try to come before 9AM to avoid the long waiting.I must mention the speed and effectiveness of the entire hotel staff, from check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile. Just a pleasure.Of course, the nearby attractions - the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay and the shopping center - all of these only add to the pleasure.Don't miss the symphony of lights held every evening at 8:00 p.m.JUST FANTASTIC.MUST COME AGAIN.",August 2023,76,5.0

The Marina Bay Sands Experience,"My stay at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore has been nothing short of spectacular.First off, the hospitality was off the charts. From the moment we touched down, we were welcomed by their airport ambassador who assisted us with our luggages to our pre-arranged limousine ride.We were then greeted by the hotel personnel who were already on standby at the hotel's porch waiting for our arrival and were escorted straight to our room to check-in.As for our room, it was pure luxury. Spacious and equipped with all the modern comforts you could wish for. The attention to detail in the room decor was impressive.We were given a Dyson hair dryer, Bvlgari soap, and shampoos, Bang and Olufsen speaker, and a leather safe with jewelry and a watch compartment.All amenities can be requested through the TV in the room. There was a QR code card placed on the coffee table for contact purposes in case of any need for special assistance.We have a very well-stocked mini bar. It was extensive enough to make your own cocktails (to which they have included a cocktail recipe book). They even provided us with dried orange slices.And of course a cabinet full of goodies from assorted TWG teas, Nespresso capsules, Godiva chocolates, moon cakes, and beers to my girl's favorite Korean noodle and truffle chips.Our room also comes with breakfast, high tea, and evening cocktails, an access pass for 2 to the ArtScience Museum, and a professional photoshoot at the iconic Infinity Pool in the sky.The view from the room is also stunning, overlooking the Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, the Artscience Museum etc., which can all be accessed through the hotel itself.The rooftop pool offers a breathtaking panoramic view of Singapore's skyline, especially during sunset.We also went up to the observatory deck to get a glimpse of the panoramic city view.Thank you for the top-notch hospitality experience. It was truly amazing for our family.",September 2023,2,5.0

Breathtaking in so many ways,"This iconic building gave us a fantastic holiday experience, we loved every moment. The location is excellent for easy walking access to all the Marina's attractions and Gardens by the Bay. Welcome by the porters and reception staff was personal, friendly and efficient. Each member of staff we met added extra value to our stay by their helpfulness, care and concern for our welfare. Our room was large, beautiful, well maintained and furnished in contemporary style, the bathroom similarly so and impeccably clean. We had a super view of the harbour and Gardens by the Bay. Breakfast was a delightful experience, high quality, buffet style, lots of choice, attentive service. Check out was swift and a pleasant experience. One cannot visit this hotel without being thrilled  by spending time at the top floor swimming pool, so big,  warm and welcoming, lots of sun loungers and what a view - wow! The design of this architectural master piece is a joy to behold and the foresight that went into developing this amazing holiday experience is quite phenomenal and so impressive.",October 2023,242,5.0

Average - style over substance?,"I paid the fee to be an additional guest in a room during a recent stay so that I could use the hotel pool facilities. I thought the pool was great and a fun place to be, despite it clearly being a instagram  spot where everyone was focused on getting the perfect picture. The pool drinks service was great and my server Christy was very personable and attentive. Overall the pool is fun and a great place to hang out. However, the hotel is really busy in felt like I was back in Las Vegas. It’s a very impersonal experience and you are just one of many people staying there. We were told that on one of the days they were expecting around 1000 new check-ins. This felt like the case. The general hotel areas were busy and there were people and suitcases etc everywhere. I was so glad to be just using the pool and retreating to the Ritz at the end of the day. To be fair it depends what you are after. I think this hotel is style over substance. If you want the pool then great. If you want a high end personalised service then stay somewhere else.",October 2023,60,3.0

Room over looks skytree tops so we can view display at night.  It is just wonderful.  We can’t wait to head poolside- the infinity concept at this height is breathtaking",October 2023,266,5.0
Nice stay,"We recently stayed for 2 nights (3 days).  Like most other reviewers we came to experience the pool and the view from the pool. We arrived around 10:00am and we did have to queue at the check-in counter for perhaps 30mins - not sure why it seems to take so long to serve each guest. Our room was not ready - which did not surprise us - but we were given temporary cards to use the facilities. Luckily we had packed our swimwear in hand luggage, so we went straight to the pool deck and changed. There were plenty of lounge chairs available - however no surprise the ones with a little shade were all taken. The pool is spectacular & water is a lovely temp. There seemed to be limited places in this area to get a photo of the city buildings - without the pool/all the people in the pool - unless you're actually in the water. You can get an unobstructed photo/view the other way towards the harbour - but otherwise the observation deck is the best option.Reception contacted us by email/WhatsApp around 2:30pm to let us know our room was ready. Luckily we did not have to queue again to receive our permanent keys. We were on 41st floor with Harbour View Room - the view was great. Our room was lovely, king sized bed & large bathroom, with good selection of toiletries and a huge TV - but as would be expected from a 5 star hotel.  We found all the staff to be friendly - always saying hello etc.Breakfast we had down on lobby level at Rise - extensive selection. We waited for approx 10 mins each day to be taken to a table (both days this was after 9:00am).Checkout was at 11:00am - which was seamless. We were not leaving Singapore until later that night so Valet rep came and grabbed our suitcases for safekeeping. Another staff member approached us in the queue, took our keycards and told us all done. However we went back & checked & spoke to another lady who then provided us with temporary cards to enable us to use the facilities until we were getting picked up later that night. We did not know this option was available to us, otherwise we would have packed our swimwear etc in our hand luggage.We did visit the observation deck later in the early evening with these temporary cards - so they did come in handy.It's a very busy hotel - the staff try hard to make it not so impersonal but it does seem a little that way. We did enjoy our stay here - but don't believe it's value for money.",October 2023,239,4.0

DON'T PLAN YOUR SPECIAL OCCASION,"We have booked this hotel for one night on 4th Sep 2023, On which we were having our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We have already told to hotel prior making the reservations. At the time of Check-in I have confirmed the same thing asking for any arrangements from the Hotel side they simply refused and said they havent got such any information which was really annoyed us. They told us by evening we will arrange surprise for you, but nothing happens,  we are still awaiting... We have reached hotel at 12.45 pm in afternoon they would refused to give us the room as room has'nt ready and give temporary key for Observation Deck and told that they will give Email or Call after the room is ready, till 2.30 pm we haven't received any information then we go back to the reception and ask for the room. They said the room is ready for Check-in. So again feeling weird that they did'nt have any courtesy for the communication.We have asked for to increase some hours for late Check-out but again they simply refuse and said only for 1 hr. Atlast, When I have shared our experience to hotel staff, they are giving the look totally blank.In total the Iconic symbol of Singapore is not worthy to stay, its better to go on Observation Deck alone rather than to stay at this hotel.SPECIAL: ATLEAST DON'T PLAN YOUR SPECIAL OCCASION, THEY CERTAINLY KNOW THE BEST WAY TO RUINED.",September 2023,1,2.0
How much are you willing to splurge?,"After having visited the Sky Park Deck on the hotel's 57th Floor, I decided to splurge and stay at the hotel to celebrate a special occasion.  At check-in we were told they'd ""upgraded"" us to a ""better"" room but in a lower floor! There was a cake in the room, which is appreciated. The infinity pool on the 57th Floor is great and the main reason for our splurge - but getting there required taking 2 different elevators. The breakfast was good too.  Rooms are definitely not worth the charges! And while I will grant them their hotel practice to not even extend the check-out by an hour (""We're fully booked"" but rooms were available online), I was upset at a charge for the included breakfast which would have gone unnoticed, and other guests have complained about this practice too.  Something fishy about their accounting - I was asked to sign ""disputed charges"" statement seal that they stamped and had ready for such ""disputes"" on their invoice.",August 2023,10,3.0
A Dream Proposal Come True,"It can't be more true that the reputation of this hotel precedes it. Nice environment, quality rooms, and first class service by the highly professional staffs of this hotel.My girlfriend (now fiancè) loves the marina bay area, so I chose MBS hotel to spring a surprise proposal. The proposal involved a quite a number of people and required a few factors for it to be a success. Even up to proposal day, I still had a number of uncertainties, which could have led to a huge fiasco if not for a few notable hotel staffs who helped me along the way:Roshini, the front desk staff who is surprisingly still in training, shows passion, poise, skill, tactfullness and sensitivity beyond her years in the hotel industry. She was ever patient, very friendly and proactive to set into motion the requirements needed for my proposal to be a success. I think it was through her that the hotel got to know of my plans, which led to a cascade of valuable help. She will go very far if she maintains this valuable attitude. I wish her all the best.Louise, a guest-relations officer and ambassador of the premier services, who was touched by my story and was so passionate, thoughtful, proactive, professional and alert in helping me. She was my extra pair of eyes to ensure my proposal went smoothly. Her services gave a very warm touch and and an extra element of delight into the execution the proposal, such as a cake, champagne and premium souvenir mugs to remember MBS hotel by. She even briefed her team about me so that her colleagues could help me in my time-sensitive endeavour in case she was not available (But she was available to help throughout). A true precious hidden gem among the strong team at MBS hotel.Then there were also Pau and Allie who were so patient, helpful and warm in helping me to accomplish tasks that made the proposal all the more brilliant. I'm very thankful for all their great help.In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, as i'm confident that they will be in good hands. Thanks MBS hotel.",September 2023,2,5.0
"Sick in Singapore, and MBS staff were amazing!","I was in Singapore on business and, unfortunately, I ended up having to stay in the room for several days because I got sick. As a result, I became very intimate and familiar with my room, moreso than I would've liked... Luckily, the room itself was very nice with a balcony and a very comfy bed which I spent tons of time in. The staff were also amazing; they brought me anything and everything I asked for (tons of water bottles, food, kleenex, a humidifier, etc.) so I could get well. They even came up to my room to refill the humidifier for me upon request!It is very depressing to be sick while away from home, but being so well looked after by the MBS staff and catered to made this unfortunate circumstance much more tolerable. Thank you for doing such a great job and making sure I had what I needed when I was unwell!",August 2023,109,5.0
Thank you for the unforgettable memories,"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands to propose to my girlfriend.I started communicating with the staff about 3 weeks prior to our stay regarding the room decorations and bouquet preparations, and their quick response time made the process very smooth. To be honest, I was a bit nervous about preparing for the proposal because I was going to propose overseas and my English skills were not very good, but their support  was excellent and once I started contacting them, I was able to proceed with the preparations with confidence.Upon arrival at Marina Bay Sands, two staff members escorted us to our room. We were thrilled to find champagne and chocolates in our room. I think they took special care of us because we had told them of our plans to propose.While we were in the room being briefed about our stay and the proposal, the other staff member was at a distance showing her around the room and chatting with her, which helped to camouflage the conversation about the proposal. It was a casual but attentive response.I had planned to propose after dinner, but due to the combination of premium service hours and room departure time, I thought it would be difficult to accommodate such a request to have the room decorated during dinner. Therefore, I did not request room decorations in the end, but the staff was flexible and even decorated our room during dinner (we had communicated the room departure time and dinner time via whatsapp, in case you were wondering). What was supposed to be a surprise for her ended up being a surprise for me as well.With the help of the staff, the proposal was a success and she was able to cry and be happy.It was clear to me that Marina Bay Sands is supported not only by its great location, but also by the flexibility, thoughtfulness, and care of each staff member.

Amazing hotel but not sure I’d do it again,We stayed one night in the hotel. The good parts of it are the staff are fantastic. Friendly and very willing to assist. The room was clean and spacious with an amazing view of the city. And of course the rooftop pool is simply amazing. However the room was missing glasses and a few other items which was surprising. The bed was also very hard. Some people would like this but I prefer a softer bed. Overall it was a great stay however I don’t think I would do it again as I didn’t really think it was value for money.,September 2023,459,4.0
Stunning hotel and overall an amazing experience,"We have just returned from a super couple of days at MBS. We travelled in from our 2 week holidays in Thailand and this 2 nighters at MBS was going to be a fab way to end our wondeful holiday and the hotel didn’t disappoint. From the lobby to the infinity pool, to the shopping mall to the restaurants, this hotel is stunning. We were fortunate enough to be given two newly renovated rooms on floor 21 and our views were incredible. The rooms were faultless, stunning decor, all amenities. Given the huge price tag in this type of establishment, the kids were under strict instruction not to eat or drink anything in their room !! The prices for the cocktail bar in the room are outrageous !! The breakfast buffet was amazing, busy ? Yes but amazing and impressive when you consider the size of this hotel. You need key cards to get everywhere and this is a good thing to avoid non guests in guest areas. The pool IS as breathtaking in real life as it is in the TV programmes and photos and honestly weirdly never saw it crowded despite visiting at various diff times of the day. Note - there is construction work going on at the moment - the gym is closed so you need to walk over the road to the convention centre to that gym and you can see and hear a little the work going to on renovate other rooms on lower floors. There is a crazy busy road outside the hotel so I’m not sure how pleased I would have been to have been given a lower level floor - the views and noise must be pretty annoying if you were on say floors 5/6/7….We went down to the mall to eat dinner and into places like Chinatown. Budgets didn’t stretch to the restaurant in the hotel ! (but we had breakfast included which was great !)We used the concierge a couple of times and the ladies there were so helpful and friendly (big thanks to Adele who booked our transport to the airport).Overall we were wowed by MBS which was exactly our hopes and intentions for our short visit.",August 2023,166,5.0
Not good,"I just curious about this hotel, and I decided to stay here, what nice about this hotel is the view I stayed at the top floor, the room are modern and nice comfortable, but the services is so bad for the price I paid,  feel like the staff are grumpy and zero hospitality. I absolutely not going to return here.",June 2023,6,3.0
An Awesome Experience,One of the most iconic hotels of the world. The Sands Premiere rooms are renovated ones and bigger. The ambience of the room is really good. The access to the infinity pool on 57th floor is a wonderful experience.,September 2023,2,5.0
Good experience,"The thing that was the most impressive for us was the rooftop pool. Great vibes overlooking stunning views of Singapore. The room in itself was okay, nothing worth the high price tag. But the hospitality was good.I would go for the city views rather than gardens by the bay as the later looks very tiny from above and not so impressive even at night.",October 2022,15,4.0
DON'T PLAN YOUR SPECIAL OCCASION,"We have booked this hotel for one night on 4th Sep 2023, On which we were having our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We have already told to hotel prior making the reservations. At the time of Check-in I have confirmed the same thing asking for any arrangements from the Hotel side they simply refused and said they havent got such any information which was really annoyed us. They told us by evening we will arrange surprise for you, but nothing happens,  we are still awaiting... We have reached hotel at 12.45 pm in afternoon they would refused to give us the room as room has'nt ready and give temporary key for Observation Deck and told that they will give Email or Call after the room is ready, till 2.30 pm we haven't received any information then we go back to the reception and ask for the room. They said the room is ready for Check-in. So again feeling weird that they did'nt have any courtesy for the communication.We have asked for to increase some hours for late Check-out but again they simply refuse and said only for 1 hr. Atlast, When I have shared our experience to hotel staff, they are giving the look totally blank.In total the Iconic symbol of Singapore is not worthy to stay, its better to go on Observation Deck alone rather than to stay at this hotel.SPECIAL: ATLEAST DON'T PLAN YOUR SPECIAL OCCASION, THEY CERTAINLY KNOW THE BEST WAY TO RUINED.",September 2023,1,2.0
How much are you willing to splurge?,"After having visited the Sky Park Deck on the hotel's 57th Floor, I decided to splurge and stay at the hotel to celebrate a special occasion.  At check-in we were told they'd ""upgraded"" us to a ""better"" room but in a lower floor! There was a cake in the room, which is appreciated. The infinity pool on the 57th Floor is great and the main reason for our splurge - but getting there required taking 2 different elevators. The breakfast was good too.  Rooms are definitely not worth the charges! And while I will grant them their hotel practice to not even extend the check-out by an hour (""We're fully booked"" but rooms were available online), I was upset at a charge for the included breakfast which would have gone unnoticed, and other guests have complained about this practice too.  Something fishy about their accounting - I was asked to sign ""disputed charges"" statement seal that they stamped and had ready for such ""disputes"" on their invoice.",August 2023,10,3.0
A Dream Proposal Come True,"It can't be more true that the reputation of this hotel precedes it. Nice environment, quality rooms, and first class service by the highly professional staffs of this hotel.My girlfriend (now fiancè) loves the marina bay area, so I chose MBS hotel to spring a surprise proposal. The proposal involved a quite a number of people and required a few factors for it to be a success. Even up to proposal day, I still had a number of uncertainties, which could have led to a huge fiasco if not for a few notable hotel staffs who helped me along the way:Roshini, the front desk staff who is surprisingly still in training, shows passion, poise, skill, tactfullness and sensitivity beyond her years in the hotel industry. She was ever patient, very friendly and proactive to set into motion the requirements needed for my proposal to be a success. I think it was through her that the hotel got to know of my plans, which led to a cascade of valuable help. She will go very far if she maintains this valuable attitude. I wish her all the best.Louise, a guest-relations officer and ambassador of the premier services, who was touched by my story and was so passionate, thoughtful, proactive, professional and alert in helping me. She was my extra pair of eyes to ensure my proposal went smoothly. Her services gave a very warm touch and and an extra element of delight into the execution the proposal, such as a cake, champagne and premium souvenir mugs to remember MBS hotel by. She even briefed her team about me so that her colleagues could help me in my time-sensitive endeavour in case she was not available (But she was available to help throughout). A true precious hidden gem among the strong team at MBS hotel.Then there were also Pau and Allie who were so patient, helpful and warm in helping me to accomplish tasks that made the proposal all the more brilliant. I'm very thankful for all their great help.In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, as i'm confident that they will be in good hands. Thanks MBS hotel.",September 2023,2,5.0
"Sick in Singapore, and MBS staff were amazing!","I was in Singapore on business and, unfortunately, I ended up having to stay in the room for several days because I got sick. As a result, I became very intimate and familiar with my room, moreso than I would've liked... Luckily, the room itself was very nice with a balcony and a very comfy bed which I spent tons of time in. The staff were also amazing; they brought me anything and everything I asked for (tons of water bottles, food, kleenex, a humidifier, etc.) so I could get well. They even came up to my room to refill the humidifier for me upon request!It is very depressing to be sick while away from home, but being so well looked after by the MBS staff and catered to made this unfortunate circumstance much more tolerable. Thank you for doing such a great job and making sure I had what I needed when I was unwell!",August 2023,109,5.0
Thank you for the unforgettable memories,"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands to propose to my girlfriend.I started communicating with the staff about 3 weeks prior to our stay regarding the room decorations and bouquet preparations, and their quick response time made the process very smooth. To be honest, I was a bit nervous about preparing for the proposal because I was going to propose overseas and my English skills were not very good, but their support  was excellent and once I started contacting them, I was able to proceed with the preparations with confidence.Upon arrival at Marina Bay Sands, two staff members escorted us to our room. We were thrilled to find champagne and chocolates in our room. I think they took special care of us because we had told them of our plans to propose.While we were in the room being briefed about our stay and the proposal, the other staff member was at a distance showing her around the room and chatting with her, which helped to camouflage the conversation about the proposal. It was a casual but attentive response.I had planned to propose after dinner, but due to the combination of premium service hours and room departure time, I thought it would be difficult to accommodate such a request to have the room decorated during dinner. Therefore, I did not request room decorations in the end, but the staff was flexible and even decorated our room during dinner (we had communicated the room departure time and dinner time via whatsapp, in case you were wondering). What was supposed to be a surprise for her ended up being a surprise for me as well.With the help of the staff, the proposal was a success and she was able to cry and be happy.It was clear to me that Marina Bay Sands is supported not only by its great location, but also by the flexibility, thoughtfulness, and care of each staff member. Although I can't write it all down above, they also took care of many details for us. We will stay at Marina Bay Sands again after our wedding.Finally, I cannot thank enough all the staff members who were involved in our stay, especially the two staff members who assisted us primarily with the proposal.

Stay away from Marina Bay Sands Hotel!,Expected an amazing stay with the nice architecture and location!  The management ruined that!  Stayed there 2 nights and wanted to have drinks with friends at Spago's on the roof. We were held back at the entrance because management requires every person to hold a room key to enter from 57th floor tower 3 where we were staying.  I told them we just need to walk to the restaurant but no we had to travel down to the 1st floor the take the tower 2 elevator to 55th floor then transfer to 56 floor elevator just to go to the entrance of the restaurant. Unbelievable!  Mr. James Tan was very helpful whereas all the other personnel working there have no brains and they should not be allowed to work in the hospitality industry! Management has no clue their ridiculous rules are ruining future business.Also at 11pm they allowed kids in diapers with their parents into the jacuzzi!  REALLY! Management should instead have a sensible rule where kids are not allowed in the pool area after 9pm!,September 2023,37,3.0

The hotel is so large you don't feel like you get any benefits for being a hotel guest, we had to queue several times just to have a drink.

Completely Different than My Last Visit...Exceeded All Expectations!!!,"My family recently (October 2023) stayed Marina Bay Sands (MBS).  This was my second stay at MBS (my first was in July 2018), and the level of service my family and I experienced far excelled the service I received during my last visit.  Following my 2018 visit, I thought my stay at MBS then was amazing and their service quality was solid (I stayed in one of their Club Rooms then).  I could not imagine that the level of service could've improved - but it did!We chose to stay in one of their newer Family Suite Rooms, and we took advantage of the Family Escapade Package.  We were a family of three and we appreciated the extra space, and additional bedroom we had in the suite.  The extra touches the suite had with respect to the free snacks for children, in-room books to read, keepsake back-pack, and plush Rori the Lion were nice additions and perfect for our 16.5 month old son.I would like to especially call-out Ms. Jemcy and her Premium Services Team for making our stay memorable!  Ms. Jemcy and her team made everything about our stay very easy.  From arranging airport transfers, transport to/from a family photoshoot away from the hotel to arranging late check-out -- they took care of us from the moment we cleared immigration and customs to when we checked-in for our departing flight.  Yes, there was also a team at Changi Airport to help with arrival and departure!  I thought that the Premium Services Team's use of WhatsApp to communicate service requests was very smart, and it was convenient.  I also really appreciated the in-room check-in and in-room check-out that we got, so there was no need to line-up in the queue at all.  We were met at the Hotel Entrance when we arrived at the hotel and escorted straight to our suite.  When we left, the team was outside our door for a bill review, to help with our luggage, and to make sure we had everything & didn't forget anything in the room.What was really touching for me and my family was the gift our family was presented with from Ms. Jemcy and her team when we checked-out.  We were genuinely surprised and touched!At the end, my family and I were sad to leave!  Ms. Jemcy and her team made everything so easy, all my family and I had to do was create memories to cherish in the years to come.Thank you again and our family looks forward to staying at MBS again!",September 2023,4,5.0

Expensive but an absolutely unique experience and worth every penny,"I work in a charity in rural Bangladesh and recently decided I needed a break and dipped into my savings to stay at the Marina Bay Sands for two nights. Have wanted to go for years but it's significantly outside my normal price bracket. It was an amazing experience and  I was lucky enough to have view over the Bay Gardens. When I went in to the room, as the door opens, the curtains automatically opened on the panorama. This was quite a contrast with rural Bangladesh and I was so astounded I burst in to tears! Which brings me to haw lovely the staff were. especially Crystal on reception and Art who took me to my room and coped with my mild hysterics admirably. So much to do in the hotel and surrounding shopping complex museum etc, not forgetting the Bay Gardens. The swimming pool and observation deck add further to the uniqueness of this environment and it was two days I will never forget.

The room, infinity pool and restaurants is very nice. We had unforgettable experience at this hotel for our anniversary. Here's hoping to see Honey again for my daughter's birthday next year!",November 2023,1,5.0
Amazing birthday experience,"We had an amazing stay at Marina Bay Sands where we celebrated our daughter’s birthday. The customer service was truly exceptional - thank you especially to Karu, Honey, Ed in Spargo, and Mark at the beautiful infinity pool.

Good service by Front Office Rose,Rose was very cheereful/ friendly  and gave us the best service when we check in. She was very accommodating and very pleasant welcoming us. She loves our baby too!  Check in took less than 5 minutes. She gave us a complimentary upgrade to the city view which we were so grateful. The room was very spacious enough for our baby to move around and it’s big enough to accommodate a baby cot.Rose even arranged an Anniversary cake for us. Such a lovely girl.  Thank you for the good service and we definitely remember you !,November 2023,1,5.0
Great experience,"Experienced the Marina Bay Sands Hotel located on the 44th floor Sky View (Facing City)Absolutely amazing room and views, the infinity pool especially at night time was amazing.The location is perfect.Yes it is expensive but it is worth it for the experience.Voted 4 stars due to the checkin was below standards as I asked for reservation for the Ce La Vi restaurant weeks prior but at check in the staff was rude and denied this request and made us look like idiots.The manager at ce la vi made up for it.",November 2023,35,5.0
Once in a Lifetime Experience,"We would like to recognize a special employee at Marina Bay Sands who made our stay forever memorable!  His name is Robert, and he was the butler for our Room 4178 in Tower 2.  We were unexpectedly upgraded to an amazing room that came with butler service, an experience that for us was once in a lifetime.  Robert attended to our every need, and more than we could imagine, including arranging and personally escorting us to our own cabana at the infinity pool, where we got to see a spectacularly beautiful sunset!  When we got back to our room, there was a lovely anniversary cake and personal hand-written note by Robert waiting for us.  He also arranged professional limousine service to the airport, again personally escorting us, along with other butler staff members, to the limousine.  Robert and the other staff at Marina Bay Sands made our 39th wedding anniversary truly unforgettable!  Thank you, Robert, and the staff at Marina Bay Sands!Sincerely,Brian & Cynthia",October 2023,1,5.0
Exceeded My Expectations,"So I went into this stay with not the highest expectations, but more of it satisfying curiosity and allowing for many instagramable photos. Anyway, I was recently in Singapore for a few days, and decided I would try the Marina Bay Sands as I had been to Singapore mangy times, but never been to the hotel, and really just wanted to go to the pool, and since you can’t use the pool without staying at the hotel I thought why not.The hotel is not cheap, although I did stay in December so I expected it to be pricy. Overall, my room which was a king size with a slightly upgraded view (which actually turned out to be great) and breakfast for two added came to a total of $867 for one night – pretty steep, but this is Singapore. We arrived at 11:00, and hotel check-in isn’t until 3.  I had asked for an early check-in as a courtesy before I arrived, and they said they would try, but of course since I am not a casino high roller, and it is also a very busy hotel there was no room ready when I got there.  They do, of course give you a key that allows you access to all the amenities, so if you want to go to the pool, gym, etc. you can. Our room was ready at  1pm, so we only had to spend two hours wandering around, which really wasn’t that bad since the hotel and adjoining mall are massive.  But to the meat of my review.  While we could not get checked-in right away, the service from the moment we arrived at this incredibly busy hotel was excellent. Everyone from the bell hop to the concierge, to the check-in person is extremely polite and accommodating, and takes time to explain the features of the hotel.  Other review lament the time it takes to check-in but to be honest (and I was expecting the worst so maybe that’s why I was so surprised), check-in went very quickly. The pool is amazing – the view are so incredible, and the pool side service despite being busy is very good.  I thought it would be like Las Vegas where it is impossible to get a chair, and you have to pay to reserve one, but despite the fact that it is always busy, there seemed always to be chairs available. The room was also very nice, as it should be at this price point, but also better than I expected.  Very spacious, with a complimentary mini bar of soft drinks, and our room had amazing views. Technically they call it” garden view” but it looks out towards the ocean, and one could  see the endless number of container ships, and the Indonesian island of Batam in the distance.  One could also see the gardens, which put on a light show twice per evening. I was quite happy with the room. As I mentioned, we paid for our breakfast for two as an extra addition to the roommate. You get a choice of breakfast either downstairs in the lobby restaurant, or upstairs net to the pool at Spago. It is important to note, that while you’re eating at the Spago venue, I do not think the food is any different than you would get downstairs. More importantly, according to the prson who checked us in, the downstairs buffet is much larger so the selection is far more impressive. Regardless, we were more concerned with atmosphere as opposed to food since we aren’t really breakfast people so we opted for Spago. This was the only time I thought the service fell short – while most of the staff tried really hard, the restaurant was really busy, and does not take reservations for breakfast so had we not shown up when we did we probably would not have made it – we did no wait that long, but there are a lot of people trying to eat breakfast at 0930 on a Saturday. There is a buffet, and an a la carte menu. The buffet is typical selection in this part of the world with a lot of Asian breakfast dishes, same thing on the a la carte menu. Our waitress seemed uninterested, and twice we had to ask for black coffee (just regular black coffee), we also had to ask for our a la carte items. Overall, I would recommend eating at the restaurant downstairs, as unless you go really early in the morning or get lucky, you probably are not going to get a table with a view at Spago, so at that point it’s more about the fodo selection. To wrap it up – and sorry for the length – the Marina Bay Sands is an amazing hotel with excellent views. The pool is stunning, and will provide endless opportunities to make your friends jealous on social media. I would probably not stay twice as I would rather at least get points if I am paying this much for a room, and frankly, even tough they do an amazing job of managing all the people it is still sort of a tourist trap.  However, it definitely is worth trying at least once  - if you have never stayed, you got to try it!",December 2023,211,5.0
