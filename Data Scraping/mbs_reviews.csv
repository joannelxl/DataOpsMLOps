All you can ask for in a hotel,"The greatest customer service we’ve ever received from any hotel: every staff from housekeeping, concierge, and premium services were amazing and accommodating. This is a great location for everything you would want to see. It is walkable distance to the nearby nature domes. There were two exhibits at the nearby ArtScience museum. It connects to the subway system if you want to explore the city like we did. There’s an indoor casino, and an abundance of stores inside the shopping center. The food court has so much variety and every place we tried was so delicious with great prices, including dessert. You could stay here and eat for the whole week if you wanted to. Daily light shows from the Garden and water show next to the ArtScience museum. Last but not least, the Infinity pool that’s available to guests only. What a view. We will definitely want to come back here when we return to Singapore.
We want to thank Yasmina for a warm welcome and helping us answer any questions we had, and every housekeeping staff that we came across.",Date of stay:
Great gym experience,"Cleanliness is great, very helpful staff. Equipment are well maintained and serviced. Amenities are plentiful, myriad of drinks and snacks to choose from. Towels and shower facilities are provided as well. All in all a good experience and would love to return again",Date of stay:
Just Wow,"Just Wow what an amazing hotel. We stayed from 18th -22nd March 2024 The staff are amazing. My partner booked this for my 60th birthday. He had booked a premium room with city view however on arrival we were upgraded to a suite. Han who booked us in could not have been any more helpful. Everything about this hotel is amazing. The infinity pool is just wow. Thank you to everyone at the Marina bay from the booking staff, our butler, the guys who moved our luggage, the catering staff and not to forget the cleaners. I was truly made to feel special & had the most amazing time thank you so much from Shirley & Lee",Date of stay:
Amazing Experience,Just amazing..Must stay place.. infinity pool gives you infinite happiness..4 storey casino was place to explore if you really interested in playing..

Soul flow,"Adelene is the best! The class called “soul flow” is a must try!! We get to exercise but it doesn’t feel like it at all! Super recommended!

I tried the pilates class with Lauren before and it was really great too! Instructors and hotel staffs are really friendly too!!",Date of stay:
Must see in Singapore,A must not miss place for tourists to visit when in Singapore. It's a pretty nice place to take a walk and enjoy the view. Plenty of people from locals to tourists. A lot of nearby restos and bars but expect it to be a bit pricey. It's free to walk around. It's nicer to do that late afternoons to evenings since it's rather hot during the day.,Date of stay:
Wonderful spa experience,"Excellent service and wonderful massage, scrub and wrap. And the location is amazing on the 55th floor of marina bay sands. Greeted mediately and was offered snacks and tea when I waited for my service. Having your own dressing room, bathroom area, that’s attached to the massage table with use of a bear made it extra special.",Date of stay:
Memorable staycation,"We had a staycation to celebrate a special moment at MBS. Inspite of my initial scepticism, it kept getting better with every experience - starting with an unsolicited upgrade of our room to a suite with a breathtaking view, later followed by a brilliantly served dinner/drinks.

But the highlight of the stay was - our morning session of sound meditation on L-57 under the open sky. It was conducted by Karuna who was kind enough to share his own story as well. Simply brilliant and a powerful session to reset myself.",Date of stay:
Best gift you can give to yourself in the morning,The Sound meditation in the morning provides me with the perfect start to my day. It helps me to clear my mind and unblock any obstacles and I feel calm and ready to take on the day ahead. I'd definitely suggest giving it a try if you want to start your mornings feeling refreshed and clear-headed!,Date of stay:
Thursday Morning Wellness Experience,Very Good Sound Bath Meditation class at the Skypark Observation Deck. Feeling lighter and refreshed. Thank you Karu and team. It is a good way to start the morning right and the weather was good. Towel and water will be provided and dress in what is most comfortable for you.,Date of stay:
Still a world famous hotel with very attentive staff,"Stayed here for one night during our honeymoon and received a free room upgrade to a deluxe bayview room. Very uncomplicated check-in process and attentive staff. The infinity pool is more like a public swimming pool and totally overcrowded. People (especially influencers) tend to go there to take pictures only and not enjoy the view itself, which is a bit annoying. But that itself is probably part of the concept and why Marina Bay Sands is famous all over the world. Our room was one of the newer rooms and everything was clean and tidy. Room service also worked without any problems. We also had a great view at the light show in the Marina Bay at night. Definitely a must stay when you are in Singapore.",Date of stay:
I recently had the most rejuvenating spa,"I recently had the most rejuvenating spa experience after a 19 hour flight from JFK. Chrystal, my massage therapist, was absolutely fantastic! Her skilled hands melted away all my tension, leaving me feeling completely relaxed and refreshed. Additionally, Honey at the reception provided excellent customer service, making me feel welcomed from the moment I walked in. The ambiance of the spa was tranquil, and the overall experience exceeded my expectations. I can't wait to visit again for another pampering session!",Date of stay:
Marina Bay Sands,"Singapore. Does it again .
Singapore Airlines is class too.

Terrible Experience at Hefty Cost,"Post on behalf of husband butnI was one of the occupants.

Subject: EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE

Although I know MBS will still fully book no matter how bad their services are, no matter how many complaints they receive, but I still wanna share the bad experiences during my stay on the 8 mar.

1st Booked 7 rooms, sent email to request check in together for all rooms, reservation team replied ok, but during check in, front desk was unfriendly and said cannot check in together because I was not there and my wife checked in for me. My wife requested high floor and only given 7th floor, and she requested to check in together so that my guests will not get low floor, but front desk person said will try their best, so wife requested the lady to prepare all keys and I only need to retrieve when I reached with guests. The front desk lady said ok but when I reached with guests, front desk took 1 HOUR to give me key cards!!! Really really bad!! All the promises were all lies!! My guests are extremely disappointed all due to MBS EMPTY PROMISE AND inflexibility and rigid staff. Despite me paying so much but not getting the right treatment is just basically horrible.

2nd, we got 7th floor room and there was strong sewage smell, wife told the housekeeping but She gave only diffuser and explained cannot do much because smell from drain. The housekeeping lady was nice but she couldn't do much and Wife needed to go off and front desk packed so couldnt request for room change. Ended up we believed the sewage smell or diffuseR cause my son's nose to be sensitive and did not feel well after spending the night there. Really really bad!!! Spent 10k yet stayed in sewage smell room, emailed MBS ask for compensation and yet MBS person said no compensation. Of course la, they wont bother small business from me, they no need do any nice thing hotel also full, so why would they bother about my complaint right! They called me to say sorry but useless la... The sewage smell was obviously full of bacteria.

3rd, the worst part ---we went for breakfast at Spago and my wife almost ingested a part of chipped handglove is really atrocious and disgusting. I seriously thinking of cirluating the photo around but my wife's stopping me from doing so. I was not there with wife, because I was busy, if I were there, should really post the disgusting glove in porridge. They took the glove rather quickly though. So they waived off the breakfast but I think that was only fair because we didnt even eat anything after that disgusting glove! I WANT TO HIGLIGHT THIS, how can a hotel claiming to be a 5 star hotel making such unacceptable nonsense mistake? Totally atrocious. I paid a lot of money for the smelly room with unhygienic retaurant.

Sent few emails but no reply until say will.pst FB, so called to say sorry, which really useless. Compensation should be given but like i said, their business good so they cant be bothered.

I am extremely angry, disappointed and unhappy with my stay at MBS, share with you all la to make this known or I feel sibei imbalance. 10K le!! Yet worth less than 1k for sure!",Date of stay:
Nice Room - mediocre service,"Booked a gardens view room but got offered a city view suite in Paiza wing at no extra cost. Overbooked?. Very luxy suite with electronic everything, including toilet!. Lots happening city side and it turned out a good decision to swap views. Hotel is vast with a 20 minute walk min to most restaurants in the Shoppes mall. Gardens by bay light show is underwhelming and can be viewed from observation deck anyway. Very impersonal mega hotel - mediocre to poor service.",Date of stay:
Marina Bay world class,"Amazing hotel and loved the facilities. Being someone that enjoys the gym I was so pleased with Chanuk and Oddie who served me and provided great tour of the gym and was blown away. They are a credit to the hotel.

Must visit hotel and experience",Date of stay:
An amazing experience at the Marina Bay Sands,The team at Marina Bay Sands really created a phenomenal experience earlier this month when we stayed there for our Taylor Swift concert trip. The amazing Butler team made the whole trip so seamless for all of us. Thank you Danial and Brady. Of course there are few others we don’t know all the names. It was an amazing experience of the lifetime that my goddaughters would never forget. THANK YOU for your hospitality. You are really impressive!,Date of stay:
Nice touch.,"While the initial check in experience was not as expected, Nicole from management called and went above and beyond to offer solutions.
Nice touch Nicole, This hotel is well located and is very well maintained. Friendly staff are within reach and are very attentive.",Date of stay:
Amazing experience at MBS with superb hospitality and services,"I booked the Sands Premiere Suite to celebrate my anniversary with my fiancé. We received amazing services from The Premium Services, a major shoutout to Eunice for her amazing hospitality and making our Anniversary celebration an especially memorable one. Its definitely one of our best staycays; the room looks even better than the photos, the bath tub was so big, and the amenties were well maintained. The hospitality and services provided by all the service staff were top notched and highly professional. We highly recommend it for any celebrations :)",Date of stay:
Incredibile,"Nina is amazing as all the team, I loved her hands and the facial massage . The spa is a beautiful location at mbs and the final treats are amazing. Please go if you have the chance, this is quite expensive but it worth, great experience with my friends",Date of stay:
No one will care about your requests at this hotel.,"1st night so far and extremely disappointed.
Checked in after midnight. Paid full rate and upgraded to a premium room at over $1000 per night.
Notified hotel about our super late checkin days in advance and requested a room on higher level and close to Elevator.
After waiting 35 minutes to be checked in, we were given the lowest level and as a result due to lower level , long walk away from the elevator.
Much worse than not caring about our requests was the interaction with front desk,
1st manager did noting and her manager came out repeating exactly what the 1st person was sayings: simply ""sorry thats all we have ""
If you care about customer experience, this place is NOT IT.
5 STAR HOTEL acting as a 2 star hotel when it comes to customer service.
Will see how the remaing 2 nights go and will post an update.",Date of stay:
Bucket list hotel,"We splurged to stay here for the final night of our Singapore stopover. We were lucky to get upgraded to a newly renovated room overlooking the park, and it was pure luxury. So this review comes with the caveat that we did not pay full price for the room we got. If we'd stayed in the lower room type we actually booked (which was still incredibly expensive), our review would only be 4 stars because it wouldn't have been as special.

Moving on... The lobby was busy but there were helpful staff to direct us, and check-in was relatively easy. We tried using the app but it wouldn't sync our booking to our room (possibly because of the upgrade?).

The rooftop pool is as amazing as everyone says. Unfortunately we had bad weather and didn't get to fully enjoy it, but can't blame the hotel for that.

If you get a room overlooking the park, you can enjoy the Supertree light show from the comfort of your room! Great for us since it was raining during the show, so we didn't have to risk getting soaked.

They kindly gave us access to a shower room after check-out so we could freshen up before our evening flight home. It was basically a small hotel room (no bed) with the bathroom stocked with amenities, plus water bottles and snacks. Amazing!

It's important to note that all the shops and restaurants in the adjoining mall have significantly inflated prices. Even Starbucks and Din Tai Fung (dumpling restaurant) were way more expensive than at other Singapore locations. On that note, we highly recommend Origin + Bloom cafe in the lobby for a coffee and pastry.

Would we stay here again? We wouldn't come back until all rooms have been renovated, to ensure it's the special experience you'd expect for the price you pay.",Date of stay:
The perfect anniversary celebration experience,"The perfect experience for an Anniversary celebration, thank you to all the MBS team! From the pre-hotel transfer arrangement, to the welcome surprise, to even more lovely surprises, we were spoiled beyond belief.
It was our 30th dating anniversary and I chose a Suite at MBS to spend a special night with my wife. We enjoyed the whole experience: the room was fantastic, the service was incredible, the attention to detail second to none, the pool lovely as always, breakfast was good. We got help from the team booking a last minute reservation for dinner at one of the MBS restaurants, which was fantastic, but our choice of restaurant was not as good as others we've had before at MBS. Still very grateful to the MBS team - you guys rock!",Date of stay:
Wonderful stay.,"I usually find hyped up hotels disappointing but not Marina bay sands hotel. It was amazing and lived up to the reviews. The infinity pool was superb as were the helpful staff, finding me a pod to sit in as I had to stay out of the sun. The room was beautifully appointed with nice little added touches, bookmarks and cable ties left by room staff and a soft drink complimentary bar with crisps. The two breakfasts restaurants were excellent with fabulous choice. Perhaps the most pleasing aspect was that we had booked 3 nights but had to check out a night early as we had made a mistake with our flight and Judith, the manager agreed to just charge us for 2 nights. This was very much appreciated. Thank you to all the wonderful staff at marina bay sands.",Date of stay:
Great to see,"It was an amazing experience inside the Marina bay sands, luxurious and artistic. Went to the other shopping side to see a wonderful canal ride. Venice like setting inside the luxury all around. It had a great casino also to have a look around.",Date of stay:
Relaxing and tuning in to self through various textures of sound,"What a lovely way to start the morning!
Peaceful with serene morning breeze and awesome sights of Singapore. It was at the top of MBS (on level 56). You’ll get a 360 degrees view from there. Not just the coast, but also Gardens by the bay, the buildings around and all.",Date of stay:
Good customer service,"Roselyn was very professional and attentive during her shift. Cheers!
Definitely felt the price was worth it during my stay here at the gym.

She knew what exactly was needed or wanted. Thanks to her services, I definitely would come again. The rest of the facilities was amazing too, thanks for having us.",Date of stay:
Excellent infinity pool,"The pool is amazing and most rooms have some view. The hotel is kind of set like a Vegas hotel with many stores and restaurants inside the hotel. The rooms are of decent size and the breakfast in the top restaurant has great atmosphere. There are many things to do to keep yourself occupied along with it, many popular attractions are close by.",Date of stay:
Chris at the Gift Shop Practically saved us!,"Went to stay at MBS while I do medical check up, can absolutely say their service is amazing especially Chris at the gift shop, we were in need of a umbrella as it was raining heavily late at night and I guess the gift store was about to close but Chris from the Gift Shop, reopen the counter and even asked us if there is anything else we need! Superb hospitality even from the Gift Shop. Top Notch",Date of stay:
Bucket Luxury Hotel Experience,"We stayed in this iconic hotel for a bucket list night. We did all our Singapore touring before we had our 1-night stay so that we could enjoy the hotel amenities the WHOLE time without leaving the property. We spent a lot of time at the pool. It rained one afternoon, but we were the first ones back in the pool once it was cleared from the lightning storm. The Infinity pool gets high ratings. Wasn't too crowded and we were able to get the seating right next to the pool.
We enjoyed our balcony the most --recommend facing the Gardens. We were able to sit back, relax, and watch the Gardens by the Bay Light show.",Date of stay:
The hotel is perfect!,"The experience of staying for 3 days in this hotel is fantastic, because of the great and professional services from Eunice Marasigan , everything is perfect! My kids really have a great time playing in the swimming pool and having fun in different kinds of activities, the breakfast is great too! Will highly recommend to my friends!
I am looking forward to my next staying here now!",Date of stay:
One night only if you must!,"We will certainly never stay here again. First impressions stick and MBS made a lasting impact with our arrival. 5 rows deep of taxi chaos out the front of tower 1 was a prelude. Our luggage was whisked away (more about this later) and we entered without a greeting. Looking up in the lobby is a marvel but at ground level totally inhuman. Packed, nowhere to sit and oddly walled off from the long spectacular space with high wall of a food outlet.

Shockingly our next experience was a three row deep snaking queue to check in. Our wait was 50mins, standing. Trying to download and use their app to check in was fruitless as, on our phones, registration for an account didn’t work. Finally we got to our room (tower 3 a decent walk away) eager to head to the Gardens by the Bay nearby but another wait began for our luggage. We called about its whereabouts twice during our wait of 45mins and no one could tell us where is was or when we could expect it.

Dinner: I mistakenly assumed that staying here we would be able to get a table for a meal. Every table was booked so no such luck. Fortunately as the crowded but incredible rooftop pool was a reason we wanted to stay, we could get a basic meal in our swimmers.
Better communication before arriving could have helped on this point.

Our experience of the MBS was epically impersonal, way finding was non existent (prepare to get lost and confused!) and an antiquated lack of sustainability practices topped off the experience.",Date of stay:
Amazing!!,It is an amazing place. There is so much to do but you will need at least 2 days to see the area. The gardens are beautiful along with the mall and don’t forget the hotel that has the roof top bar and if you stay at the hotel you get to enjoy the infinity pool overlooking the beautiful city.,Date of stay:
Professional service,"Visited the hotel for some drinks and what I really wanted to say most was the wonderful service provided by the staff. Saraswathy, Sazali, Maadesh and Nicholas were all so helpful and friendly, very very professional individuals. DJ at the front drive was also so helpful in trying to help me figure out how to use the grab app to book a ride home when my bank was under scheduled maintenance and did not allowed me to top up my grab wallet. These team members are truly an asset to the company. Thank you all.",Date of stay:
Great hotel,Amazing hotel in an ideal location! Staff went above and beyond. Check in was welcoming and had our room ready early for us which was very welcome after a long flight. Our room was on the 51st floor with a view of the gardens. Housekeeping staff were excellent! Nothing was too much trouble. We had breakfast there and the choice was endless.,Date of stay:
Always a perfect experience!,"Always an amazing experience. Everyone is super professional and kind. The room is clean and the bathroom very luxurious. But the best are the massage beds. They are very wide and comfortable.

Nelly and Sand are the best!!! They always make us feel stronger and more flexible after every session.",Date of stay:
Sublime Service 6 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"The experience was amazing and the service top notch luxury. We all felt very special and cared for. 6 stars for sublime service…

A dream come true!,"I left my heart at Marina Bay Sands! Worth the splurge to swim in the infinity pool overlooking Singapore in their most iconic landmark. Every thing about it was fabulous! I enjoyed the Taylor Swift light show, access to Gardens by the Bay. Loved it!!",Date of stay:
So bad.... only stay if you deserve punishment,"If I ever have burning desire to:

• Pay for a highfloor harbour-view and receive a lower floor garden-view
• Listen to jackhammers and other refurbishment/construction noises ongoing from 09:00 onwards during my entire stay
• stay in an overrated room which has damages, shoddy completed repairs, and no toilet roll (I have pictures)
• stay in a dirty room with dust everywhere and rust stains on the lamps (I have pictures)
• miss out on Internet, TV and Telephone for more than half a day (unannounced and no updates)
• reregister my keycard again because the elevator no longer accepts my original keycard
• have breakfast at 6:30 because that’s what the advice is and when it is the only time it is not crazy busy
• stand in line for every possible restaurant or feature
• especially just ridiculously overpay for the experience

Only then will I return to the MBS.

I believe that hotel restaurants should cater for guests first and then for 3rd parties. To not be able to reserve a table for the next 2 days as a hotel resident is just absurd.

I was promised unparalleled luxury matched by exceptional service and I got neither – I have travelled extensively in the world including to sunny Nigeria and other parts of Africa and this hotel for me was the biggest disappointment of all - I would rate the premises akin to a single star rating at very best.

I did not enjoy every minute; in fact I did not even enjoy one single minute of my stay and ohh by the way…. it cost me a small fortune.

This review was sent to MBS for comment but they decided to stay silent.",Date of stay:
Perfection! Superb service and a million dollar location and view of Singapore,"We started our vacation in Singapore by staying here for 5 nights, and enjoyed every minute of it. Yes, it is a large resort and very busy, but that is part of the glamour and excitement. Our room was in Tower 3 on the 33rd floor overlooking the gardens. We found the room to be very clean, spacious with modern amenities. A ginormous flat screen TV. The resort provided bottled water plus complimentary beverages in the small refrigerator. Nice robes and slippers for our comfort and use during our stay. Also gave us a big platter of fresh fruits upon arrival and mid stay.

The view overlooking the garden was a bonus, as we enjoyed the light shows in the evening right from our room. Facing the gardens also gave us sweeping view to the sea. Part of our reasons for staying here is to use the stunning rooftop infinity pools on the 57th floor. Nothing short of perfection. The pool staff is elite, the food and beverages were superb, and we used the pool during the day as well as at sunset to maximize the amazing views. To see the bright moon light up the sky filled with beautiful city lights was so special.

The location of the resort is also great. Just a walkway to the Gardens By the Bay, as well as to endless restaurants and shops. Even a food court/center, filled with many great eats (in AC!). The MRT is also located nearby. We also used the gym a few times, although with quite a walk from our room. We walked the pedestrian Helix bridge to reach the Singapore Flyer, as well did the short way over to Lau Pa Sat hawker food center. We felt the city is very walkable, even went to the Merilion statue via the route around the waterfront.

As for the resort staff, it is clear that they have extensive service training. Special thanks to the front desk staff for smooth check-in and check-out process. We especially enjoyed talking to Din and Adele at the Concierge desk, they were delightful and so helpful with our questions.

With the highest rating of 5 stars, we really wanted to give the Marina Bay Sands 10! Bravo!",Date of stay:
Magicql Sound Healing with Kanu,"The sound healing with Karu was one of the most magical, heart opening experiences I have ever had…
I was in awe, the perfect balance of peace, tranquility, beauty with sounds that literally moved the body….
They say when the student is ready, the teacher will appear…. But in this case, i think the experience helped me to arrive in a place of openness - my heart is full of compassion.",Date of stay:
I Love This Hotel,"I was in Singapore and knew I had to stay here, I booked a room for us on a Sunday night and was so happy I made the effort to do so, I was in 2 minds whether to book, its an American Vegas style hotel in Asia but it was so worth it you get the fantastic service and hospitality of Singapore but the fun aspect of an American Vegas style hotel. Our check in was seamless Patrick was lovely Peach very helpful and May upgraded us, so we were super happy. Our room was on the 39 floor overlooking the gardens, so nice for the show in the evening (although I would recommend actually being in the gardens for it to get a better experience,if your not there for the show do have a walk around its lovely, the animal sculptures of endangered species is very moving) You walk into your room and the curtains open, a nice touch with a great view. The decor was lovely with some very nice design touches, beds were amazing, bathroom super luxe and toiletries were Jo Malone also being upgraded you get a much nicer robe which becomes obvious when you are at the pool! The pool... so worth it! there is an adults section which is great however being a Sunday there wasn't too many children about, the beds get busy but there is a constant turn around 1 thing we didn't realise there is sun screen provided near the area you do the pool check in. As only hotel guests can use the roof top infinity pool it makes you feel special! the pool is 1 of the reasons to stay at the hotel and it really was a fantastic view and yes I got lots of pictures of me at the edge like in the advert for the hotel! We ate at the pool so food was from Spago a Californian restaurant with a very nice menu, while I was staying elsewhere I came to MBS and ate at CUT by Wolfgang Puck which I highly recommend the chicken is enormous it arrived as a full bird 1.1 kg they took it away and carved it for me. While staying at MBS we ate at the new French restaurant DB Bistro which we didn't enjoy so much maybe it was not to our taste? We visited the casino, free to tourists but $150 for locals! you must have your passport and Singapore landing card to enter. No quite as much fun as a Vegas casino the games are a little different and the gambling seemed more intense, but we had to give it a go and it was a nice finish to our evening. I read a lot about this hotel and on my visit to eat there before my stay there I was a little shocked how busy it was and felt it was almost a little too touristy, but that aside the architecture is totally amazing, the staff superb, if you love to shop the mall is great every shop you could possible wish for if you like high end, the evening light and water shows are a nice touch and I must say my whole experience was 10/10 we loved it, would I return now that I have done the pool and casino YES I would.",Date of stay:
Average,"Although the hotel is spectacular to look at, it’s very average to stay in. The room we stayed in was very tired with stained carpet and stained robes. The pool is beautiful but not easy to swim in as not surprisingly is used as personal photo shoot for the guests. Guests appear to be lazy with leaving towels on beds so you never know which beds are free. The staff are lovely and helpful. We are glad we stayed here for the experience but if we return to Singapore, we will probably stay elsewhere",Date of stay:
Another Exceptional stay,"My daughter and I have just returned from an exceptional stay in a city view suite. WOW WOW WOW what a suite, unbelievable and what wonderful services. We had an amazing stay, love everything from the room, the services, the rooftop pool,, the afternoon teas, the food, the shops, the helpfulness of all the staff (except for 1 rude old man working on level 56! Thank you to everyone who made our stay so special",Date of stay:
Crazy Rich Singapore Vacation,Sooo I’ve seen Crazy Rich Asians numerous times and wanted to see the Marina Bay Sands in person. It is spectacular and overwhelming all at the same time. The rooms floor to ceiling windows with the Amazing view and the luxurious toiletries are and plus. The bed is comfortable but it’s really just a blip on the radar. Now for the Rooftop Pool yes it was Everything I’d hoped for. Now the staff throughout are Amazing we went to the front desk looking for a ATM and one of the Lobby Ambassadors escorted us all the way to where the ATM was located near the casino. I’d like to give a special thank you to Lobby Ambassador Mr. Patrick and Bell Captain Mr. Suresh Rao you both were very kind and beyond helpful during our stay,Date of stay:
A great experience,"This hotel is really massive. However the rooms are very nice, we had a great view over the gardens by the bay with the super trees. Our room was spacious and provided a great place to relax.
Breakfast can get a bit busy, so to avoid queueing up I would suggest arriving for breakfast at around 8:0am. There is plenty of selection at breakfast and the staf are efficient.
The hotel is connected to the MRT, Shopping mall and casino so its very easy to get around. The super tree grove, Floral fantasy, Cloud forest and flower dome are all within walking diatance.
The infinity pool at the rooftop is great for one of those photo opportunities, as is the observation deck. Both are free for guests. The pool is for guests only, whilst the observation deck is chargeable for non guests.
This hotel does not come cheap! But its location is perfect.
Staff are helpful. Our thanks to Balan and Ray for their help.",Date of stay:
Memorable stay for the family,"A very short trip, but an experience my daughter will not forget. The family room was amazing. Spacious and lovely furnishing. Our daughter loved her little retreat with the game console and amenities.

For the parents it was just perfect for the short stay. Very comfortable.

Would like to take the time to thank Eunice from Premium services. She was very friendly and always helpful. ""Thanks Eunice""",Date of stay:
Best gym of our trip,"Comprehensive amenities in a modern environment with a nice view overlooking the convention center. Good mix of cardio equipment and weigh training as well as coffee, tea, other drinks and snacks. The attendant Lucy took excellent care of us and treated us to cooled towels at the end of our workout.",Date of stay:
The best hotel in Singapore,"Marina Bay Sands is hands down my favorite hotel in all of Singapore. I stayed in the newly renovated rooms in tower 2 and had a beautiful view of the Gardens by the Bay. The mall attached is breathtaking and the hotel offers so many restaurants you can’t go wrong with any of them. Lavo was amazing for a rooftop experience (highly recommend the meatball!) , Wakudu had the freshest fish if you’re looking for high end Japanese cuisine, and you can’t go wrong with room service.

Every part of the hotel is a work of art. Almost every part is a picturesque moment! The rooftop pool is breathtaking and is the best view in Singapore. Also, Marquee is the coolest club you’ll ever go to. A Ferris wheel and slide attached that you can’t miss.

Most of all, the employees and premium services were extremely catering, helpful and fast. Shoutout to Eunice from Premium Guest Services for going above and beyond each day of my stay. She gave me all the best recommendations and she was swift with all my responses. She also assisted me with all my rides to and from the hotel with ease.

This hotel has it all! If you’re just visiting, I highly recommend staying for at least 2 nights to explore all MBS has to offer!

Utter bliss,"Oh wow. What an amazing stay. We requested two standard rooms overlooking the gardens on the same floor. On arrival one of the rooms was not ready so they upgraded us to a two bedroom suite with a city view. It has spoilt us for ever. Two nights of bliss. Treated like VIP’s and could not fault anything. The attention to detail was amazing and the quality of the furnishings, bed linen, toiletries were just beautiful. Even the toilet was awesome. We didn’t want to leave. The pool was fabulous but the suite just made our stay. Thank you Kath and MBS for an unforgettable experience!",Date of stay:
not sure i would go back,"we went last summer. it is architecturally very impressive, but the hotel is so big that the service does not feel very personal. we arrived early and asked if we could check in early but this did not seem possible. the hotel lobby has no comfortable seating areas so we asked if we could find somewhere comfortable to sit, but this did not seem possible. as the hotel is such a landmark, the lobby is full of tourists and visitors, so as a resident you never feel the quality of the service. the restaurants, shopping mall, infinity poor and viewing deck are all amazing but you just do not get the personalised service a 5 star hotel should give you.",Date of stay:
The most incredible hotel,"One of the best hotels in the World that I have stayed in and I have stayed in many luxury hotels due to my job. From the minute we arrived we were met at the door and escorted to our rooms where check in took place which was seamless and so efficient. The rooms are out of this world and spotless and the attention to detail was fantastic. Breakfast is superb! The staff are incredible from the pool staff to the restaurants staff but the best service we had was we had booked a departure transfer to the airport which was late arriving due to a mix up but was handled very well. When we arrived at the airport there were 2 staff members from the hotel waiting for us to assist us to the tax refund and check in- I have never had such service in my 45 years in the industry all I can say if you can stay at this hotel it is a once in a lifetime experience.

Thank you for making our trip memorable!",Date of stay:

Spectacular experience beyond expectations!,"Amazing experience for the whole family.
We booked one of the newly renovated Family suites, and I must say that we have never experienced such luxury. Not only the facilities was extraordinary but the hospitality and service from the MBSPremium Services was next level and beyond our expectations.
Starting from pre arriving until checking out and after they just took care of us and helped if we needed anything. House keeping was nursing the room every time we left and freshened up everything.
We will definitely come back another time!",Date of stay:
Fantastic experience!!,"We booked two nights at the Marina Sands to end our trip to Singapore.
What can possibly be said about staying at such an iconic hotel.
The experience alone is amazing and with so much to take in can be a bit overwhelming.
( Definitely in a good way ).
The roof terrace and pool are just amazing and the views are incredible.
We had a fabulous room overlooking the gardens and watched the light show from our balcony.
I was taken aback by the structure of this hotel but what impressed me more was the way the staff seemed to run everything so efficiently,from the breakfast on the ground floor which was fine with plenty of choice available,to the bar service by the pool.
The check in was straightforward and when we checked out,we were given our pool access cards back which enabled us to enjoy the rest of the day relaxing before our 12:30 am flight home.
I must mention the lovely Ivy and Sara whose patience with me at the check in and checkout desks was impeccable.
Also Shasi who brought our
luggage and told me all about the hotel.
A real nice guy.
All in all an experience that will be impossible to forget.

Breakfast wasn’t good either
The room nearby has been under construction for six hours. without prior notice. The noise prevented me from resting comfortably.
Despite this noise, the room was not replaced.

I heard a hammering from 8:50 a.m. the next day.

The Marina Bay Sands hotel is perfection at its finest,"We originally booked two king suites for our family of six. We were surprisingly up graded, free of charge to the presidential suite!

The staff were absolutely amazing, the bedrooms were stunning, both with breath taking taking views, the suite was immaculately clean and modern.

The complimentary breakfast, canopies and drinks, butler and limousine were the icing on the cake to our 2.5 week holiday of south East Asia as well as the amazing ininfinity pool.

Opulent!,A spacious room with a wonderful view of the gardens by the bay. Staff were very helpful and efficient at check in. Balcony was beautiful and much larger than most hotels.

best friends in singapore,"When I checked in, I told them that I only speak Japanese, and they called for a Japanese staff member, who was very helpful. He consulted me not only about Marina Bay Sands but also about Singapore and various other matters. Our staff are humble, kind, bright, and have wonderful humanity. I felt like I had made the most reliable friend in Singapore. We also appreciate the information staff who entertained us with simple English during the waiting time. I am honored to have met a gentleman with a wonderful smile. There were so many other great staff members that I would love to be friends with. I would like to visit them again.

チェックイン時、日本語しか話せない旨を伝えると日本人スタッフを呼んでくれてとても助かりました。
彼はマリーナベイサンズのことだけでなくシンガポールのことや様々な相談にも乗ってくれて嬉しかったです。謙虚で優しくて明るくて素晴らしい人間性を持っているスタッフです。シンガポールで一番信用できる友人ができた気分でした。

What an experience,"Wow. Firstly, as a quick “down side”, be warned that there are a lot of people in the foyer. But even though there are lots of people, the customer service team have a knack for seeking you out amongst the crowd to see if you need anything. How they manage to know who is who is beyond me. Room is impressive. But the real highlight is of course the infinity pool and deck. It’s magnificent and the service that comes with it is what makes it so iconic. Thank you to Christy who treated my 5 year old son like he was royalty. Despite the price, the deck is considerably child friendly (I thought it wouldn’t be). There is a separate adults only section to prevent annoying relaxed adults. Food and beverage was fantastic but be prepared, it’s pricey I found the cafe downstairs (Bloom) decently priced for a coffee and croissant. All in all, an iconic experience worth doing once in your lifetime.",Date of stay:
Great service but too many people for us,"We stayed here for 4 nights in Tower 3 on the 20th floor. It is a bucket list place to see and stay and like others have commented the staff is great!! So friendly and will go out of their way to assist. Ziu from the bell desk gets a 10 plus. He assisted us with our luggage when we were checking. The pool is great but the first time we went in the afternoon there were no lounge chairs anywhere near the pool. Reminds me of the situation on a cruise ship. Sky deck is on floor 56. They do not make it convenient at all for people staying at the hotel to get back to their rooms. Had to go to first floor and go back inside to get to our tower elevator. Then there is the crowds. If you are not a fan of lots of people, might want to re-think staying here. Restaurant prices are quite high and very little selection for a reasonably priced breakfast. The Origin+Bloom was close to affordable for a coffee and croissant. We had a great view to see the light show at 745pm at Gardens by the Bay.",Date of stay:
"Consistently great experience at The Banyan Tree Spa, MBS","I have always enjoyed my monthly trips to Banyan Tree Spa at Marina Bay Sands.

What makes my trips worthwhile is the Master Therapist Experience which is one of their signature treatment. Sand was the assigned therapist for my last two sessions and her techniques are therapeutic. Without fail she would unknot the tight spots troubling my shoulders and lower back and I would leave the spa feeling reinvigorated.

Also commendable is the professional and friend disposition of the front desk receptionist, Ernita. She is conscientious and takes pains to ensure that both check-in and check-out processes are seamless and efficient. This includes follow up email confirmations on next appointments.",Date of stay:

WORTH THE AMAZING EXPERIENCE,"Spent 2 nights here a a little reward for both of us after a hard 4 months. It’s not cheap but wow, it’s an amazing place. From arrival by van to a chaotic entrance, we both wondered what check in would be like. Not a worry, the whole register and check in was so fast and easy, we were both impressed. It didn’t stop there. Room not ready so given 2 cards to the Skyroof Infinity Pool. The surprises continue. It’s a massive pool spanning across the 3 towers and on the 57th floor. Plenty of chairs, lots of room in the pool and really prompt service for food and drink. A special mention for Mark who looked after us each day. The views of Singapore from the pool deck are breathtaking. One side is the City and the other side is the Harbor which resembles a full car park of ships waiting to load or unload. Received a phone call to advise our room was ready. Rooms are very well appointed as you would expect for the price. Only issue was the provided pillows were like bricks. A quick call to housekeeping and that was resolved quickly. Check out was even faster, an express reader that swallows your room cards and emails a settled account. The only suggestion we could make is there is absolute nowhere to sit in the building. Everything is expensive but as a treat very much worth the experience.",Date of stay:
Great experience at MBS gym,"The gym staff were attentive and address my questions. The drinks counter was well stocked after a gym workout to cool down. Not to mention that Chanok, Uma, Affa and Anant were welcoming and made my stay comfortable and memorable. The gym was located away from the hotel, a considerable walk from the rooms.

We stayed in a premium suite with a beautiful view. The room was fully electronic with everything at the touch of a button. When you open your door lights and tv turn on, curtains open. The bathroom had the most amazing toilet/ bidet which was all at the touch of a button including individually programmable. (It’s the little things)
The rooftop pool was beautiful. Towels, sunscreen and lemon water were there for your use. There was also drink and food service.
The hotel also had a walkway to the shops, casino and metro train which we used and found convenient and less expensive than taking taxis.
There is a little cafe which we used for breakfast and it offered tea, coffee, juice, breakfast sandwiches, yogurt etc. Simple yet filling and delicious.
Definitely a must stay if you are visiting Singapore",Date of stay:

There is a mall next to the MBS hotel with lot of restaurants. We enjoyed the river cruise from this location and the cruise was almost private with one other couple in the boat however sadly you can't take night time tour as the cruise at this place closes at 5 PM. The Quay has night time cruises and I saw many boating slowing down during the spectra show.",Date of stay:

Rooftop pool really is spectacular, unfortunately rained while we were there through the day however we went at night when it stopped and the views were outstanding. Also had two hot tubs over looking the other side.

Pure luxury and the highest level of service!,"Although we had a minor issue at check in, the hotel management, namely Victor Mai, took full ownership, kept in touch with us, and resolved the issue way beyond our expectations.

This is customer service at the highest level!

The hotel is stunning, seriously high end, and there isn’t anything the MBS team won’t do for you to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

Our family suite was phenomenal and our girls loved the play room/bedroom (Nintendo Switch).

The food here is exceptional. We had breakfast at Rise each morning and had a special anniversary meal at Spago on the rooftop, which was outstanding!

I think for what you get at this hotel, its truly value for money, the hotel staff truly care about your comfort throughout your stay and let’s be frank, there are no better views in Singapore than here.

Thank you to Victor and the MBS team for making our stay so special and one to remember.

Excellent Stay at MBS,"I am with my elderly parents and my older brother who flew all the way from Canada to celebrate the 87th and 81st birthday of our Dad and Mom.
I booked the 2 Sands Premier Suite since December 2023 as I wanted to make our parents’ birthday memorable.
I emailed the MBS to avail the Merlion Suite originally as we stayed there in July 2022 but unfortunately its apparently under renovation.
So I settled for the 2 Sands Premier Suite instead.
I roped in the help of MBS n Januat 2024 to have my parents’ room decorated with flowers, balloons, birthday greetings, champagne and fruits and MBS threw in complimentary cakes as well.
I also requested 2 wheelchairs and possible early check-in and late check out too.
3 days before our visit to MBS , they send a reminder for out check-ins and I confirmed with then all the pre-arranged surprises for my parents.
The room reservation, room-in dining , Bayfloral all have confirmed that all the arrangement are smoothly on the way, although some miscommunications happened when I was confirming the arrangements but…
What impressed me the most was the MBS premium services that oversee that all the arrangement will happen and more… Ms. Precious, Ms Lucy of MBS premium service and in-room dining addressed all my concerns and Ms. Maria of Bayfloral as well thru our communications via email. MBS premium services sent a message to give them a heads up once we ate on our way, as the 2 wheel chairs will be waiting for us.
On the day of our arrival Ms. Eunice Marasigan was waiting for us at the lobby, though I missed the message who are we supposed to meet thus, we alighted from our transportation and proceeded to request for wheelchairs. When Ms. Eunice spotted us that’s where the magic started… from the very start she assisted us with genuine warmth and sincerity, she was honest that the 2 rooms are being prepared as well as the surprises, so she lead us to RENKU for complimentary breakfast where Sheila assisted us while waiting as Eunice checked in for all of us,and provided us temporary keys for the gym and infinity pool. Since we anticipated that rooms might not be ready yet, we had a lunch reservation at RISE so Sheila of RENKU helped us move to RISE restaurant with all our complimentary drinks in tow.
While having our lunch buffet at RISE, Eunice keeps us updated with our rooms( we requested if PAIZAPremier Suite is available instead but unfortunately not), she surprised my parents with cakes and birthday song compliments of RISE staffs( separate review on this).
Once our rooms are ready, we were led to it and MBS wowed us with the floral arrangements, balloons and birthday greetings( c/o Bayfloral) adorned the room of my parents and the fruits and Piper-Heidsieck Champagne (c/o MBS in-room dining) with complimentary MBS cakes and fruits as well. My parents were so surprised and overwhelmed!! Goal achieved!
Ms.Eunice also helped us how to go to KOMA for our dinner resevation ( separate review) and she also readied our transportation for the next day to our lunch reservation to ATLAS( another review) a complimentary limousine ride. She always updated and assured us during our stay.
She come across as a very genuine, sincere staffs who is going above and beyond, MBS is fortunate to have her as she will definitely brought her A game and made the guests feels very special. Kudos as well to Jeff and Jonald who assisted us on our check-out and the kind gentleman whom I forgot to get his name who drove is to ATLAS.
We woke up late the next day and still tired so we decided to order a in-room dining for breakfast instead of availing our complimentary brekkie to RISE and Spago. It’s very convenient to oraer thru TV and very promptly delivered. Variety of choices too. After that we went to infinity pool but to do photo shoots only as we are rushed for our next appointment.
Thank you! All in all, our MBS stay is memorable. We will defintely come back and visit again!",Date of stay:

Avoid Marina Bay Sands During Construction!,"Just checked out of Marina Bay Sands. I have stayed at the hotel 15 times before. Just a word of warning:

1. Construction is incredibly noisy from 9 am to 6 pm and on weekends. It is Loud. The bed is hard as a rock and I hope they change it out.

2. They were working on the room above us and knocked out the air conditioning and the electric.
3. I never complain and mentioned it a checkout saying paying $1,000 for a room with no AC and packing my bags in the dark is ridiculous.
4 There response was we are sorry, no credit to your $1,000 room and have a nice day.

The only reason you should go to Marina Bay now is if you are dead set on the pool. The pool is great, but the construction is over the top loud and the hotel really doesn't have to care as there is always another unsuspecting guest.

We are coming to Singapore for the 4th time this year and are staying at the Mandarin Oriental this time. The only thing I'm missing out on is the Marina pool.",Date of stay:
Perfect Stay!,"Excellent experience!

Of course the hotel is iconic, but the personal attention and customer service is outstanding. Eunice anticipated everything-- before we could even think of it-- and added little touches to make the stay truly special.

What an experience. Wished we had booked 2 nights,"Lovely hotel and staff
We booked 1 night stay as a treat to be able to use the infinity pool. What an experience. Wished we had booked 2 nights.
Check in and was told we had been given a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite from Premium King for 3 people. Arrived and as we opened the door all the automatic lights came on , curtains opened with a view across the harbour and down onto the Supertree Grove. We were celebrating a birthday which I had noted on reservation and we had a birthday cake delivered to the room by the butler. Did not even know we had one !!. Room was not ideal for 3 people but we made the best of it abd used the facilites that were on offer. They even had a karoke set up in the living room so we had a great time using that. Never felt so spoilt.

Only issue was within 24 hours of checking out the hotel took an additional cost charge for something out of the minibar which we did not have. Despite confirming with the butler are other additional charges",Date of stay:
Beautiful and Excellent Hotel!!!,"This is my first time visiting Singapore and It's second stop of honeymoon. Marina Bay Sands are very famous, so my wife and I decided to stay at it for two nights when we first arrived at Singapore. We booked the premier suite with city view since it was honeymoon. The hotel team kindly offered us complimentary pick-up and also sent us to our next hotel when we checked out. In-room check in was great. The cake and wine were also very delicious, thanks for that. The hotel is very beautiful and views are great. The rooftop pool is great for the view and I think it looks better at night. The breakfast has very rich selections at the first level restaurant, and I didn't try the breakfast beside the pool. The hotel also has mall and casino, also many good restaurants. Overall, it was really great experience with Marina Bay Sands! Thanks MBS premium service team Allisa for the quality service.

Very crowded (also due to Chinese New Year which dod not give me a nice relaxed break moment on this trip.

Our room was nothing special in size nor in luxery. It was on the 7th gloor with a view at….. the walls of the shopping malls.

Breakfast at the top floor near the iconic pool was expensive but amazing! Food at the pool was very over priced and portions to small.

"Not family friendly, treats teens as adults for pool access","MBS is well known but in my opinion overrated. The rooms are overpriced for the type of room you get. I work remotely and take my work with me when I travel. Most 5* hotels have a business center. When I asked the front desk one of the staff was confused as to what a business center was. Another staff then said their business center is in the convention center but it’s all booked. I have a feeling they don’t really know what a business center is and that they don’t have one. I don’t mind working from the room, but I prefer working from a business center or a lounge area. There is no convenient lounge area. This hotel doesn’t even have a real lobby to rest your legs.

We were only here for a few days. We also tried their dinner buffet which was very good. Service was a bit slow though it is CNY and a busy time. When we were seated we were informed our champagne would be served right away. It was about after our second round of getting food that our champagne was actually served. Then when we paid the bill our server asked for us to stay at our dining table so they can double check our room number is correct. After waiting for 5-10 minutes the server never came back to let us know we can leave. We had to hunt down help to confirm it was okay to leave the dining area.

The other area we accessed was the pool. The worker “Vicky” was checking in guests. I understand the pool is for guests only and you need to swipe a card per adult guest. I have three kids and they claimed my two teenagers ages 15 and 16 are adults. And they would “let me in this time” but next time to register them so they have their own hotel room card to access the pool. I’ve never heard of such a ridiculous requirement and shouldn’t this be something when we were checking in that the front desk advise us of?

The hotel is conveniently located with lots of things to do. But I do not consider this place family friend or work travel friendly and likely will not be coming back.",Date of stay:
The BEST hotel ever!!,"The wonderful experience started with the lovely, short-haired, friendly woman who helped me check in at the front desk. (Maybe her name is Levie?) She is the nicest hotel employee I have ever met! I really appreciate it, thank you very much. In addition to impeccable cleaning, a pleasant smell that fills the room, and sufficient amenities, there are also ample hotel facilities. This is exactly the hotel stay we were looking for. I have never had such a wonderful experience. This is definitely the best hotel. It's worth visiting Singapore just to stay at this hotel. I will definitely stay again. it is really amazing! !",Date of stay:
Va va voom,"The spa experience was absolutely out of this world. From the moment you step out of the lift to the left landing to the main reception area where you are greeted by warm receptionists and the nicely decorated banyan tree and crystals, to the meeting of the therapist before the spa treatment. Not forgetting the after spa experience!",Date of stay:
"Nice hardware, horrible software - MBS isn't luxury.","The CNY period is busy for everyone, but most luxury hotels find a way to manage. Not true for Marina Bay Sands. The check in experience has been appallingly bad.

To not have any rooms available until 3 pm is understandable, albeit inconvenient - but to not have a single seating area available for guests to wait in is absolutely unconscionable. There are ZERO chairs / couches anywhere on the first floor, they've decided to monetize by giving every last inch to the buffet.

My elderly parents are traveling with us, and we had to walk around for 30 minutes looking for a place to sit. We finally squeezed in a beach in the food court area in the mall to wait an hour for our rooms.

I was then called, and specifically told ALL three rooms we booked were available (I made sure to ask). We all walked back (again - a long distance) to be told, just kidding, only one of the three was currently available. What should my elderly parents do in that case?

Finally, even after we made it to the rooms - it was literally a 45 minute wait for our luggage to arrive.

I have traveled extensively around the globe, and Marina Bay Sands ranks amongst the very bottom. They have an iconic location, the views are nice, the service staff have been trained to smile and say nice things - but it is far, far from a luxurious experience.",Date of stay:
Amazing service - go elsewhere to fine,"Their service was impeccable. But unless you're hungry, the buffet at Rise was overpriced ($300 for two salads and a glass of wine). Food service was very rushed in Spago (despite there being other tables available, so there was no need to rush us out to turn our table over). Lavo for dinner was so noisy and crowded we couldn't talk.
Wonderful place to stay - go somewhere else to dine.",Date of stay:
The treat for myself,I always enjoy the experience in Banyan Tree. It has such a unique and relaxing ambience and therapists are skilled and well trained. It cannot compare to any other places and is accessible easily. All the staff are super friendly and attentive.,Date of stay:

Great Stay at Marina Bay Sands Greatly Elevated by Outstanding Support,"The Hotel itself and its related establishments already are quite the accommodation.
But what made our trip really special was the support from Glaiza Gonzalez and Mark Delegero from the premium service team. From the moment of our arrival, their attention to detail and dedication to ensuring our comfort and satisfaction were unparalleled.
Glaiza's professionalism and warmth made us feel immediately welcome, while Mark's assistance throughout our stay added a personalized touch that truly set this experience apart.
The level of service delivered by both was truly a testament to Marina Bay Sands' commitment to excellence.
Highly recommended for those seeking an unforgettable experience with support that goes above and beyond!",Date of stay:

"Humongous, unique hotel, magnificent pool (but photos taken by photographer are too expensive!)","The main reason I chose this hotel for the second time, is the marvellous infinity pool. Be sure to spend at least a few hours in the pool and jacuzzi. This location is unique for great pictures and videos. Before sunrise and sunset are not to be missed.

The hotel itself is enormous, but most (like the delicious restaurants, the Shoppes and the shows) is also accessible to non-hotel guests. So, make sure to explore this hotel, even if you’re not a guest, it’s an experience in itself.

The staff is very friendly, giving tips and helping out when necessary. One time I got out of the pool at 23:51, and my belongings (luckily only my room card inside my hotel bathjacket) were taken away prematurely. So be aware of this if you intend to stay in the pool until midnight to not lose your valuables! I thus had to go to the first floor with a new jacket and towel I had received by the staff at the pool to obtain a new room card.

Breakfast was very expensive, so if you consider having breakfast, try allocating more time and making a brunch out of it at the Rise restaurant. This way, you kinda get 2 meals for the same price, which makes it more affordable.

The room was good, with a nice view on Gardens By The Bay for us. I would have liked a movable spray head in the shower though, as a fixed one is not handy.

The fitness is good enough with various machines, and helps you keep in shape for the duration of your stay.

The hotel is expensive though, which is normal for the luxury you obtain in return. The reason which refrains me from giving this hotel 5 stars, is the absurd price of purchasing the photos a photographer has taken of you at the pool itself. The cheapest option was 120 SGD and to get all your photos digitally too, the price becomes 145 SGD, if I am not mistaken. I get that they know their audience is whealthy (otherwise they wouldn’t be able to afford such an expensive hotel), but to me it really feels like a tourist trap. It’s not like the photographer stayed 15 minutes with you to capture you from all the best angles. It was just a minute, some poses at the same spot, and that’s it. Feels like bandwork and not worth more than 20 SGD. Even though, I purchased the photos because I am fascinated by your infinity pool, but it gave a bitter aftertaste which damped my experience a bit.

Shout-out to Fir (@firtography1985 on Instagram) though, who volunteered to make great photos of us at the pool at sunrise with our phone!

Conclusion: I will certainly come back in the future because I love Singapore, Marina Bay, the restaurants and the Infinity Pool, but reviewing your paid photograph service at the pool would be a good thing.",Date of stay:

"Appalling stay at MBS, still waiting for recovery from their team days after check out!","I am a local who has been to Marina Bay Sands multiple times. Just to contextualise my stay, I was only at MBS to take some important work calls and to relax while my house was under renovation, but I ended up having to experience so much stress from:
1. A security breach issue that I encountered with someone else (not my guest or I) who definitely came into our room to eat one of our snacks in the mini-bar area and subsequently left the empty package beside the room refrigerator (see photo attached);
2. Equipment in my room not working (Netflix not syncing to the TV screen in the room);
3. Billing issues throughout my stay (where I had to spend more than half my stay calling or emailing their reservations team and also going down to the check-in counter at least 3 times in-person to get my billing issue resolved)
4. Not having the room service staff provide me with my birthday amenity first thing upon check-in (the friend who booked my room at MBS kept asking if the hotel did anything for me and I had to wait for hours and ask twice before anything came to my room, and my friend who did my room booking was severely disappointed that I didn’t receive anything for a long while although he put a note in for this upon booking my room);
5. Not having my Sands Lifestyle rewards membership card credited with the rewards dollars within 48 hours of my check-out (I am still following up on this issue…)

A Nicole Yu from the hotel’s recovery team has done an investigation into the security breach issue where someone in their staff team entered my room to eat from my snack bar (but not to make up my room) while I was away from my room for lunch on the second day of my stay, but they claimed none of the staff who entered my room ate the snack (then who did, a ghost?) and informed me that they couldn’t do anything else for me as I had checked out of the hotel (the issue wasn’t resolved before I checked out anyway…so whose fault is that)? She said I could come back again to experience the hotel but why would I pay to return when I had such a stressful stay at a hotel that a) Isn’t cheap and b) is supposedly iconic to Singapore?

I have photos to share of the empty nut package by my fridge which I discovered in my room, and would like to escalate this matter to someone more senior within the hotel, but Nicole has ghosted me for the past 24 hours. I am only posting here because I haven’t had my issues resolved and am still waiting for someone from their team to get back to me.

If you’re thinking of staying at the hotel, be warned…the service is appalling and you’re paying top dollar for this. Just save yourself the stress and the trouble - there are many other better hotels for this price point in Singapore (I’ve stayed in a fair number of them especially given I am a local)!",Date of stay:
Relaxing atmosphere and massage,Would recommend a treatment here. We stayed in the hotel however if you aren’t it would be a great way to enjoy marina sands.

Great staff who gave us a once in a lifetime experience with exceptional service,"We had the most outstanding experience at Marina Bay Sands. From the moment we checked in, the hospitality, friendliness and service was exceptional.

Yve who checked us in was knowledgeable, attentive and her customer service skills were excellent. Once checked into our suite, Marvin our Butler greeted us at the lifts and escorted us to our room. We're very grateful for Marvin's enthusiasm for his role, his friendliness and excellent service. Nothing was too much trouble as he helped organise our stay from booking a poolside cabana, afternoon drinks & canapes and a sunrise breakfast to name a few of the experiences. He even hand made a beautiful birthday card and brought us a delicious cake to acknowledge and celebrate the birthday event which was the reason for our trip.

Every aspect of our suite was superbly luxurious and included amazing city and sea views. Relaxing by the Infinity Pool overlooking the beautiful city views of Singapore was also a highlight.

Wherever we went, the staff were friendly, engaging and nothing was too much trouble. Club @ Renku, Spago, Ce La Vie, Concierge & Luggage services, Poolside Bar, Limousine service, Yve, Marvin and Christelle at the airport...across all these areas, it is true to say customer service at Marina Bay Sands is outstanding.

Thank you again to everyone at Marina Bay Sands. This was an experience we will never forget.

Very poor,"Arrived on the Wednesday after a long flight from Paris. After getting something to eat we thought it would be nice to get a drink back at the hotel. The first bar we tried at the top of tower 1 was closed for a private function. We were advised to try the bar at the top of tower 3. Went there only to be advised that if we wanted to sit at one of the reserved tables, and they were all reserved, there was a minimum spend of $1000. Being just my wife and I we were not going to get anywhere near this. Absolutely ridiculous for a hotel that claims to care about the customer experience! We had booked in for 4 nights and thought it might be nice to move to a hotel that actually cares about their guests only to be told that we could get a refund for the unused nights it would take 4 weeks to process. Ended up having a drink in a restaurant on the ground floor, not the 57th floor with all the views. This hotel claims it’s 5 star but in terms of their attitude to their paying guests they are not even one star. My recommendation is to find a hotel where they actually care about their guests.",Date of stay:

Luxury hotel but services dont match the high price,"We were really looking forward to staying at this hotel. There were some positives and some negatives. Although we gave the hotel a 4 stars, there were still negatives. The 4 stars were mostly due to the hotel architecture itself. It is a beautiful, well designed hotel, rooms are really nice and very modern, with lots of upgrades.

Now for the negatives. The hotel was extremely busy so check-in process took a very long time. In fact we had two rooms and one of the rooms was not ready for hours. The rooftop pool on the top of the hotel was crazy busy. We could not find a place to sit. Looks like there are a lot of one night stay guest who just want to experience the hotel for a night. The breakfast buffer on the top floor next to the rooftop pool left a lot to be desired. The breakfast was not that great. We expected better for the quality of the hotel. We asked for a late checkout and was told no late checkout allowed. We spent good money for two rooms and thought one hour late checkout was not a lot to ask for. They did offer to store our luggage and provide a room to change but we could not stay in our room for an hour extra.

It is a pretty pricey hotel. Nice hotel and its really a choice if you want to spend the high price to stay there. The services could have been better for such a pricey hotel.",Date of stay:

During our stay, I would like to commend the services of the staffs, especially those assigned in the infinity pool and concierge. Mr Cornelius was very kind and polite when we checked-in.
When we are in the infinity pool, Mr Dennis, Mr Ramon and Ms Vicky were very friendly and courteous, especially Mr. Dennis.
Mr. Dennis has showed the hospitality trait of being a Filipino. He always checks on us and other guests if we are okay and enjoying the infinity pool. Especially those with kids like me.

"Yes, it is as unique as everyone says!","WOW! I have been traveling to Singapore for over 35 years and just went back to visit some friends and decided we would splurge and experience the famous MBS!

It did not disappoint! First, a very sincere shout out to Shei Manda, a relatively new front desk employee who checked us in. There was a long line and for some reason she was struggling to get our room arranged. I had some trouble pre-registering with the APP and she was able to overcome all of that and not only solved the problem, but some how, and for some reason, was able to upgrade us to a VIP room. I have traveled my entire working career and have had some nice upgrades but nothing compared to this. Two room Suite, with butler, and to many amenities to count.

Great room, great bed, great TV's (yes, biggest TV's in a hotel ever)

Great room service.

No need to comment about the pool, it is every bit as iconic as people say.

Service is second to none.

We will certainly be back and highly recommend this for a special event.",Date of stay:

Maria bay sand has just lifted up the level of hospitality I believe. Absolute luxury in the rooms and restaurants design and finishing is one fact you see in here, the other thing is the high level of warm hospitality and efficiency of all staff across the board. They go above and beyond to get the job done. Daily room tidy up services are what I’ve never seen anywhere before, each time you go back to the room, you see like a brand new facility. Paying attention to the details is just great 👍. We are checking out tomorrow and to be honest I’m sad and don’t wanna leave 😞",Date of stay:

Construction - loud - avoid,"We are currently staying at this hotel and the construction is so loud. I had the day called before checking in and had been informed we would be located in tower 1. On check in we were placed in tower 3 on the 28th floor. I mentioned that I knew that construction was going on in tower 3 and we didn’t want to be able to hear the noise, this has clearly been ignored. The noise is SO loud and constant. Considering how much it costs to stay in this hotel I would now pay to stay here with the constant drilling sounds vibrating above us.

There are so many hotels in Singapore, which are much better value for money. If you’re looking for a relaxing experience do not stay here.

Trust me, the pool is not worth paying to stay here.",Date of stay:
Amazing experience by the pool!,"Was such an amazing experience!! Hotel was so clean and all amenities was great!! But the infinity pool was absolutely beautiful specially at night over looking Singapore's skyline it was purely amazing. what made this experience better was the people working at the pool we were served wine by joseph and was very well spoken and well knowledgeable of the sauvignon Blanc he served to us, he really made that experience very memorable for us as he even offered me and my husband to take a photo! amazing service by everyone, up to the time we were checking out nothing but smiles will surely come back and probably stay longer!",Date of stay:
LARGE CRUISE SHIP,"If you like large cruise ships then you’re going to love this place.

Let’s start with the positives. Our room was excellent as it was recently remodeled. Not sure what older rooms would be like but the hotel is older so maybe not as nice as what we had.

Cons-
The whole hotel complex is a tourist trap.
- Check in was like a cruise terminal.
- Restaurants in the hotel are very expensive and have average food quality. You can walk to food courts in the mall …
- the pool area is like you see on a cruise ship.

Excellent stay,"From checking in to our departure to Changi Airport, this hotel was what we hoped for. I admit, I had my reservations about staying here. After all, it’s big, and heavy with tourists and there’s the big mall next to it. But instead, we received excellent service from check-in. Shie (I hope I spelled her name right) was welcoming and efficient when we checked in. She asked us what we wanted. We entered a clean, orderly, and well designed room on the 37th floor with many amenities we favored. There was juice and water in the refrigerator. The Nespresso was stocked with ample pods. There was tea. These were replenished daily. Our bathroom was spacious and stocked. The shower was comfortable. The bed was a tad firm for my bony frame but my husband was ok with it, he said. We got comfortably rested each night. The housekeeping staff were always polite and asked us about our stay. They offered to help each time.
Our view was the garden by the Bay. This inspired us to walk the paths daily (except during heavy rain). Breakfast was brought up by my husband each morning from Origin+Bloom, which was located on the lobby. Such fun! Loved their Bircher muesli and my flat white. My husband had something new each morning.
We toured the top floor where the pool and other amenities were. The view was lovely.",Date of stay:

"Amazing suite, incredible service. Being so large it can be a little crowded…..","Been to dinner/drinks many times and stayed once before some 11 years ago. This trip was good. The Sands suite was spacious and an excellent hotel room. All the gadgets. Beautifully laid out and furnished. Service at the hotel was well managed and thought through. Some parties felt a little disingenuous but the training certainly pays off.
Wherever you went on the hotel the standards were pretty consistent.
We arrived after 10pm and the Sands Lounge check in was closed so we had a queue to check in.
Limousine to and from the airport was a great help.",Date of stay:
Iconic Singapore hotel,"Wonderful! Such professional staff from check-in, fitness centre (Rosalyn and Uma) to pool staff and concierge. We have had such a great time here. We will be sure to recommend this hotel to all our friends. Thank you so much and see you on our next visit to Singapore.",Date of stay:
Great gym,This Gym at marina bay sands mall was fantastic and cosy with free weights and machines. Nice drinks too! Oh yeah the theragun massage guns were so therapeutic you have to try it. Gym staff Uma chanok and sadi were helpful and friendly. Definitely worth checking out this place!,Date of stay:
Great housekeeping and facilities!,"Chen Shun Wen is an excellent room stylist/ housekeeper. He is friendly, attentive and warm, and does the best he can to make guests’ stay very comfortable!

Disappointed;bad room assignment,"Everything was amazing on check in. Great staff, great service and amazing spacious room in Tower 3 - spot on what we expected when booking. What was NOT expected was the horrendous construction that was going on upstairs flooding our entire room.

I was so angry. On booking, I paid a small additional sum for my 6month old baby as a ‘guest’. I notified them that we have a baby, and they even put a cot and a baby bath in the room EXCEPT they also put us downstairs from 9-6 construction. My little baby, who is meant to do 3-4naps a day would not stop crying and both my husband and I had to escalate escalate escalate over a 3hr period, where I ended up sitting in the hallway in tears too, before we were given an adequate replacement room by one of the Guest Service Managers, Xavier. Terrible experience; having stayed at MBS many times in the past - I was shocked at their oversight and the time it took to rectify.

Other reasons for my rating include a very mediocre breakfast. The chef we had on both mornings couldn’t get our omelettes right (we wanted fresh eggs, instead of the pre-made egg mix and egg whites); we end up just eating croissants and mini muffins that were pretty dry.

MBS is in a perfect location for shopaholics: that is one of the reason I maintained the 3 stars rating.",Date of stay:
Terrible experience,"We normally stay at the Four Seasons when in Singapore and it was a big mistake staying here on our visit this time. Outdated rooms no where near a five star standard. The beds were so hard and felt like sleeping on wood. Bath towels were small and felt like sandpaper. When we provided our feedback to the hotel their response was that rooms in our tower 3 had not been renovated unlike rooms in tower 1 and 2 so they offered us a token $100 credit.
Check in took 40 minutes to find interconnecting rooms for our young children. Incredibly they first suggested we take rooms on the opposite sides of the floor.
20 minute wait for seating at breakfast. I could go on. Lesson learnt, will not be staying here again.",Date of stay:
Terrible experience.,"Don’t stay at this hotel. The room smelled as if someone had been sick, the mattress was uncomfortable and you had to queue for check in and queue 15 minutes for breakfast at the pool level. Once they did seat you they didn’t even pour you a glass of water. If you are looking for a 5 star property there are much better options.",Date of stay:
Beautiful hotel.Great views,"Beautiful hotel, must see on a visit to Singapore.If you are cruising and have a overnight stop in Singapore.Book a table at a rooftop restaurant (Save $60+) by going here instead of the Observation level then spend it at the bar.Best to book a table as it’s hard to get to to a restaurant without booking.",Date of stay:

Excellent service and facilities,"I stay regularly every month and it's always a pleasant experience. The restaurants are all offering excellent dishes with wonderful service. In particular I would like to mention manager Edwick who ensures that we are well taken care of even during busy nights. Rooms are full of quality amenities and very comfortable with beautiful views of the city or the garden/bay area. The newly renovated gym is amazing, with all the equipment you would need for a full workout. It also offers various drinks and massage tools to unwind post-workout. Friendly staff to assist you with anything, offered to make me tea as well.

The stunning view,"The stunning view of the city skyline that could be seen from the rooftop infinity pool was the first thing that put me in a state of awe.

If I can give 10 out 5! What an amazing treat to stay here for birthday celebrations.,"We selected this famous hotel to celebrate husband's special milestone birthday and tick ' swim in the infinity pool' off our bucket list.

Our 3 nights stay was beyond our expectations. We booked one of the newly renovated rooms and the online photos really didn't do justice. The room was large, more like a suite than a room. It is beautifully designed with all the modern fittings and fixtures, and well catered to feel like a luxury home away from home. We have stayed in many luxury hotels around the world, but never had a room with 75inch TV, a tea bar and cocktail bar. I could write forever about how much we loved the room and all the fantastic amenities.

The hotel itself also ticked all the boxes. With shopping, restaurants, train and tourist attractions at its doorsteps, there's a lot to do without travelling very far.

The swim in the infinity pool certainly did not disappoint. The views from the pool are simply breathtaking and impossible to stop taking photos from all angles at different times of the day and night.

All the staff were friendly, efficient and always went above and beyond.

We were very spoilt to have the opportunity to stay here and we can't wait to return!",Date of stay:
Lovely staff and Best Gym,"Stayed at this fab hotel for a night. Too crowded during Christmas but definitely worth to stay.
The view , the amenities were amazing.
Especiallly the gym, a little far from the hotel which shouldn’t be but all equipment available.
Service of the staff was remarkable - chanok and Lucy were on point. They prepare coffee and have cold towels. That was amazing, I mean who make your free coffee in a gym? Too good.
All the staff at MBS were good and smiling. Memorable visit",Date of stay:
The Infinity Pool does not disappoint!,"Stayed for 1 night at the Marina Bay Sands Singapore before a cruise ship departure. Paid for an upgrade so we could check in early. We stayed in Tower 2 in a Garden View King. Room was comfortable and what you would expect for a five star hotel. Separate shower, commode, and soaking tub. Marble everywhere.

Gym was nice, technogym equipment, but rather small. The MBS was renovating so we had to go across the street - about 10 mins to get there.

Rooftop infinity pool is the reason why everyone stays here. Thankfully we went in the afternoon and it wasn’t too busy.

Paid $30pp for the buffet breakfast, and honestly, despite the wide selection I didn’t enjoy it. The food didn’t seem fresh - I actually enjoyed the Westin buffet breakfast more. And the service was hardly personable, the servers didn’t look like they wanted to be there.

Would I stay here again? I would - if I wanted shopping, gambling, and entertainment in a single complex like Vegas or Macau. But if you just want to come to Singapore to relax, I might not select the MBS as your first choice. About what you would expect out of a 5-star resort with restaurants, a casino, and shopping - also expect to pay 5 star prices!",Date of stay:
Nice overall experience,"👍🏻
-Quick check in, clear direction
-Nice room view - facing city or sea
-Refreshing balcony ( and you can see birds )
-Plenty of in-room supply
-Detailed automatic functions in room
-Impressive rooftop infinity pool ( and they work hard to enhance your chance to utilise the pool despite the ever changing weather )
-Convenient connections to huge shopping centre, casino, Bayfront station, Garden by the Bay
-Express check out very convenient too
👎🏻
-the longest breakfast waiting line I have even seen( breakfast buffet waiting line can be quite long after 8:30am ), would be nice if can space out more with longer breakfast hour for busy days
-best if TV or app may show the status of swimming pool open or not, so less workload for staff to call back every time
-gym a bit too far after relocation, best to keep within hotel premises",Date of stay:
THANK YOU,"Our greatest gratitude to ALL staff members at Marina Bay Sands.

CHENNA from the Infinity Pool staff, thank you for reminding me that initiative still exists when it comes to attention and service.

Staff at the LAVO RESTAURANT, thank you for delivering one of the tastier pizzas we have ever had, and for your kind attention.

Staff at the SPAGO RESTAURANT AND SPAGO BAR & LOUNGE, thank you for making our Wedding Anniversary dinner such an enjoyable experience accompanied with excellent high quality standard food, drinks, and great service.

To Ms ESHWARI from the hotel security team, for such a prompt and kind service.

To ROSIE from MBS Premium Services, for your kind assistance to all our inquiries before arriving in Singapore and during our stay at the MBS.

To ELBERT for assisting my wife before our arrival in Singapore, in providing us with one of the best suites we have ever stayed, and for also providing us in writing with suggestions in regards to Singapore’s places and activities.

Our biggest THANK YOU to our Executive from MBS Premium Services, Ms ERICA GONZALES.
ERICA, you went far and beyond any expectations, making our stay unforgettable. From the minute we arrived at the hotel you were already standing at the front with a big smile providing us with a great personalised service and checking us in straight into our suite.
The constant assistance and communication that you provided every single day made us feel welcomed and made everything extremely easy.
The day of our check out you came to our suite straight away with the assistance of luggage service, but also you arrived with an incredible and detailed gift with a message in a card that was handwritten by yourself about our wedding anniversary.
You took us downstairs and immediately provided us with transport.
But one thing we will never forget was that you remained there for us until our transport drove us away, and I remember looking at the review mirror and you were still standing there with the biggest smile making sure that was all taken care off.

Great Time,"It was my first time and I loved it, the swimming pool especially. I went there early in the morning when there were not a lot of people yet so I could do laps. The atmosphere was quiet but you can fill the energy with a bit of music in the air and crowds slowly filling the space. The weather was comfortable with the wind. The view of the Singapore skyline was great and unobstructed 360 degrees. It was a shame I was there just in the early morning to swim, and so I missed the chance to see what it is like other times of the day especially at sunset. I guess one reason to go back 😊 Special thanks to Alvin who checked me into the hotel (and upgraded my room 😊) - he gave a nice introduction about the hotel since it was my first time.",Date of stay:

If we can afford the prices, this is the best hotel",Date of stay:
The Wonderful Paiza Suite Experience,"I had an amazing stay at the Paiza suite #4569. The experience of the entire stay truly exceeded my expectations.

Firstly, the start comes from the room. It was astonishingly huge in size. That is capable of hosting at least 12 guests. Very good for hosting a Christmas or New Year's party. The technology from this suite was insane. You can control from the ipad panel. The bathroom was amazing, too. The shower room had two shower heads. It really brings it up to the next level.

Secondly, the amenities in the suite was top notch. It even had a water menu. It is truly unique and not only cater but also exceeded your needs. The bath jacuzzi experience was superb🤩

Lastly, the butler service team, which sums up the whole luxury experience.

Mr Suba, a Malaysian butler, was so humble and passionate about service. He was so detailed in everything he does. Be it the cleanliness of the suite and maintained the standard of the service. He is truly a 7 star butler. Amazing and kudos to him! I can foresee he can go far.

Mr Paolo was amazing, too. He was patient and detailed as well. Even though how busy he gets, his smile will also be there.

Thank you so much

Just wow,"We stayed here almost a fortnight ago, and we already want to go back!

It was so much fun right from the start. We were greeted on arrival by Patrick, who asked us where Charlie was. Charlie who? Charlie’s Angels of course, lol. Then at check in, Belinda was amazing and really took care of us.

Our Sands Premier Suite far exceeded our expectations. It was on level 40 of Tower 1 with a stunning view overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Strait. Apparently this floor has been recently renovated so the fittings and furnishings were all new. At 95m2 there was plenty of room with a living room, bedroom, walk in robe and large bathroom. We could have spent most of our stay in the room but the hotel has much to offer.

After a stroll through the shopping area, we went up to the rooftop pool which is open late. This is one of the main reasons we stayed at MBS and it certainly lived up to our expectations. There are plenty of dining and entertainment options from a large food court through to fine dining options such as Tetsuya’s. We made the point of booking a lounge at Ce La Vi to watch the sunset one night - it has a view of the city skyline and you can watch the Spectra light show at 8pm or 9pm.

The hotel is 20 minutes from Changi Airport, and is located in close proximity to the city and many other sights and activities so is an ideal base for a visit to Singapore. Amazing!",Date of stay:
Below average,"Amenities are old. I am currently staying in tower 3. I made complaints about bathroom door too hard to close and open. My 9 year old could not open or close. My back started paining due to offering them to help. I was told by hotel management that they don't have other rooms as hotel is fully booked. I don't believe that was true because rooms were still available to rent online. This is what you get after paying S$1200. I have paid $400- $500 in europe , asia and US, for hotels and they offered better service. No way acceptable. Singapore is small so all location are good. Only reason for 2 star is good view from room and pool. Hotel didn't meet my expectation at all.",Date of stay:

You don't even need to bring your own suncream as it's provided.

Checked in to room with used items left behind by previous guests,"Couldn't find any channel to provide our feedback.

Check-in was fast and the lady provided us with all the information needed. Upon check-in, we were told that our room given was newly renovated and held high expectations for it. The room given looked very modern, new and brightly lit, only to notice in the evening that there's used cotton bud left behind uncleaned and when we return from dinner, we noticed that there's pieces of used tissues found on the sofa behind the cushion, which left us in disgust.

Cleanliness these days are the utmost important factor, so to have items that are used, left behind by previous guest (or god knows how many guests before you) is totally unacceptable.

This just goes to show that the bed board was not clean and dusted, neither areas of the rooms cleaned and inspected prior to giving out to guests at check in. With rising cases of COVID in Singapore, we thought hotels would ensure that their cleanliness is tip-top but this was not in our case.

Despite the points raised above, the services we received from the hotel staff were still commendable.

Just a note, we stayed in Tower 2 , room 1073 from 07 Dec - 08 Dec '23. With this review, we just hope this will alert the hotel in ensuring all rooms are thoroughly cleaned prior to every guests' arrival.",Date of stay:

Would I stay there again, No.
A very very very expensive hotel.
Breakfast was a bun fight especially at the weekend. If you are really lucky they will offer you outside under the flyover with no shade, a delight, we opted to stay inside for our 2nd breakfast.
Eggs took an age and boiled eggs were cold. Juice was watered down.
The room we upgraded for a view over the gardens which was beautiful but on reflection was it worth the extra money probably not, but it was nice to have a balcony. Bed was like a brick if we had been staying longer than 2 nights I would have asked for it to be changed.
It was a bucket list ambition glad I've done it but unless you have very deep pockets and we saved hard to afford the 2 nights we had think carefully before you go we got into the pool 1 time due to the weather.

Expensive but an absolutely unique experience and worth every penny,"I work in a charity in rural Bangladesh and recently decided I needed a break and dipped into my savings to stay at the Marina Bay Sands for two nights. Have wanted to go for years but it's significantly outside my normal price bracket.
It was an amazing experience and I was lucky enough to have view over the Bay Gardens. When I went in to the room, as the door opens, the curtains automatically opened on the panorama. This was quite a contrast with rural Bangladesh and I was so astounded I burst in to tears! Which brings me to haw lovely the staff were. especially Crystal on reception and Art who took me to my room and coped with my mild hysterics admirably.
So much to do in the hotel and surrounding shopping complex museum etc, not forgetting the Bay Gardens.
The swimming pool and observation deck add further to the uniqueness of this environment and it was two days I will never forget.

Great experience,"Experienced the Marina Bay Sands Hotel located on the 44th floor Sky View (Facing City)

Absolutely amazing room and views, the infinity pool especially at night time was amazing.

The location is perfect.

Yes it is expensive but it is worth it for the experience.

Voted 4 stars due to the checkin was below standards as I asked for reservation for the Ce La Vi restaurant weeks prior but at check in the staff was rude and denied this request and made us look like idiots.

The manager at ce la vi made up for it.",Date of stay:
Once in a Lifetime Experience,"We would like to recognize a special employee at Marina Bay Sands who made our stay forever memorable! His name is Robert, and he was the butler for our Room 4178 in Tower 2. We were unexpectedly upgraded to an amazing room that came with butler service, an experience that for us was once in a lifetime. Robert attended to our every need, and more than we could imagine, including arranging and personally escorting us to our own cabana at the infinity pool, where we got to see a spectacularly beautiful sunset! When we got back to our room, there was a lovely anniversary cake and personal hand-written note by Robert waiting for us. He also arranged professional limousine service to the airport, again personally escorting us, along with other butler staff members, to the limousine. Robert and the other staff at Marina Bay Sands made our 39th wedding anniversary truly unforgettable! Thank you, Robert, and the staff at Marina Bay Sands!
Sincerely,

Exceeded My Expectations,"So I went into this stay with not the highest expectations, but more of it satisfying curiosity and allowing for many instagramable photos. Anyway, I was recently in Singapore for a few days, and decided I would try the Marina Bay Sands as I had been to Singapore mangy times, but never been to the hotel, and really just wanted to go to the pool, and since you can’t use the pool without staying at the hotel I thought why not.

The hotel is not cheap, although I did stay in December so I expected it to be pricy. Overall, my room which was a king size with a slightly upgraded view (which actually turned out to be great) and breakfast for two added came to a total of $867 for one night – pretty steep, but this is Singapore.

We arrived at 11:00, and hotel check-in isn’t until 3. I had asked for an early check-in as a courtesy before I arrived, and they said they would try, but of course since I am not a casino high roller, and it is also a very busy hotel there was no room ready when I got there. They do, of course give you a key that allows you access to all the amenities, so if you want to go to the pool, gym, etc. you can. Our room was ready at 1pm, so we only had to spend two hours wandering around, which really wasn’t that bad since the hotel and adjoining mall are massive.

But to the meat of my review. While we could not get checked-in right away, the service from the moment we arrived at this incredibly busy hotel was excellent. Everyone from the bell hop to the concierge, to the check-in person is extremely polite and accommodating, and takes time to explain the features of the hotel. Other review lament the time it takes to check-in but to be honest (and I was expecting the worst so maybe that’s why I was so surprised), check-in went very quickly.

The pool is amazing – the view are so incredible, and the pool side service despite being busy is very good. I thought it would be like Las Vegas where it is impossible to get a chair, and you have to pay to reserve one, but despite the fact that it is always busy, there seemed always to be chairs available.

The room was also very nice, as it should be at this price point, but also better than I expected. Very spacious, with a complimentary mini bar of soft drinks, and our room had amazing views. Technically they call it” garden view” but it looks out towards the ocean, and one could see the endless number of container ships, and the Indonesian island of Batam in the distance. One could also see the gardens, which put on a light show twice per evening. I was quite happy with the room.

As I mentioned, we paid for our breakfast for two as an extra addition to the roommate. You get a choice of breakfast either downstairs in the lobby restaurant, or upstairs net to the pool at Spago. It is important to note, that while you’re eating at the Spago venue, I do not think the food is any different than you would get downstairs. More importantly, according to the prson who checked us in, the downstairs buffet is much larger so the selection is far more impressive. Regardless, we were more concerned with atmosphere as opposed to food since we aren’t really breakfast people so we opted for Spago. This was the only time I thought the service fell short – while most of the staff tried really hard, the restaurant was really busy, and does not take reservations for breakfast so had we not shown up when we did we probably would not have made it – we did no wait that long, but there are a lot of people trying to eat breakfast at 0930 on a Saturday. There is a buffet, and an a la carte menu. The buffet is typical selection in this part of the world with a lot of Asian breakfast dishes, same thing on the a la carte menu. Our waitress seemed uninterested, and twice we had to ask for black coffee (just regular black coffee), we also had to ask for our a la carte items. Overall, I would recommend eating at the restaurant downstairs, as unless you go really early in the morning or get lucky, you probably are not going to get a table with a view at Spago, so at that point it’s more about the fodo selection.

To wrap it up – and sorry for the length – the Marina Bay Sands is an amazing hotel with excellent views. The pool is stunning, and will provide endless opportunities to make your friends jealous on social media. I would probably not stay twice as I would rather at least get points if I am paying this much for a room, and frankly, even tough they do an amazing job of managing all the people it is still sort of a tourist trap. However, it definitely is worth trying at least once - if you have never stayed, you got to try it!",Date of stay:

One of those “Must Stays” that lives up to Hype!,"So, this is one of those “must stay” hotels that actually lives up to the hype. From the time we arrived in our taxi till checkout we were impressed with the staffs attention to our needs even though it’s busy all day long. The staff were pleasant and rooms clean. Even when they check your room key prior to access to the roof pool, it was painless but effective. Getting restaurant reservations when it shows booked online was also a plus. The location is of course top notch. I’m not sure I would need to stay more than a few days, but the two nights we did stay were fantastic.",Date of stay:

Still nice and beautiful but the price point is starting to be too high for what you get...,"This was likely my 4th or 5th time staying at this hotel and the views never disappoint. The brunch at Rise restaurant is also always special. However, at this price point it's starting to get hard for me to justify the stay. At approx $700 USD+ a night it was double what I've paid in the past. I didn't see much to justify. The minibar that I could enjoy (without charge) was quite bare with plain potato chips, an ""oriental cracker"" snack and some juices all full of sugar. When they mentioned we could enjoy the minibar at no additional charge when we checked in I thought about past places like ""Upper House"" in Hong Kong that had free nicely stocked mini-bars. This one at MBS paled in comparison. The bath products are slightly better than what they had before but still not as nice as those I used at the JW Marriott earlier in the week (significantly cheaper price point). I think going forward I might limit the nights I stay as 3 nights at this price point just was not worth it. Breakfast should have definitely been included. Another odd thing I noticed is that the entire check in team all wore ""in training"" buttons. I wonder why they are constantly turning over staff so much. It's a huge place and not very personal. While at the pool someone did walk around offering iced grapes which was refreshing. This reminded me of pools in Miami but in Miami they offer more... The views never get old and are among the best in Singapore. If I'm forced to end with something positive, I do like that they extended the hours of the pool to midnight.",Date of stay:

The service and staff are all quite exceptional and very well trained, in fact you can identify staff in training by their lapel badge only!

MBS - Memorable and Beautiful Stay,"My family and I truly enjoyed our stay at the MBS. Upon arrival, we were happily greeted and welcomed by the Guest Services team (Imran, Marvin & Lawrence) and assisted us with our luggage. FO-Yve was very friendly and accommodating as she process our rooms. She was very informative with all the queries I had. I would like to commend FO-Kerry & GR-Pau for their pre-arrangements and made our entire stay very comfortable and memorable especially for my mom (elderly), who was truly in awe since it was her first time to visit Singapore and stay in MBS. Waking up in the morning was absolutely beautiful with the view.

Our Room Stylist-Xing Wen went beyond an extra mile from our expectation, something I never experienced with other hotels. Every MUR was a surprise! Xing Wen probably saw the book I was reading on my bedside and gave me a MBS bookmark, arranged my charger with a MBS cable winder and provided a MBS pouch to replace my ziplock bag for my toiletries. Simple gestures like these can simply mark incredible memories.

Special thanks to Sandeep of LAVO for the great service and “Welcome to Singapore” cake. Definitely, one for the books.

Also, wonderful thanks to GS-Edz for assisting us with the wheelchair, GR-Alannis for the warm send off and GS-Sara for our luggage down.",Date of stay:

Lovely but……,"I don’t want to sound ungrateful or picky as this IS a lovely hotel. The staff are incredibly nice and it is a destination experience but is it 5 star and is it the best I have stayed? Honestly no, we did all the pre-booking registration via the app as requested. I found the App difficult, clunky and constantly logging me out. Time to book in and the App was down. Luckily we were usher to one side and the old fashioned check in commenced. Nice room, clean but a non renovated one and a bit tired. It was my husband milestone birthday and a lovely cake was waiting in the room for us. During a few days at MBS we tried room service (breakfast and dinner) buffet lunch & breakfast, drinks & snacks at the pool and a few of the restaurants in the mall. All fantastic- not a bad meal anywhere and always lovely service but nothing personal. Other than a piece of cake on our first day, which wasn’t his actual birthday during the stay there was nothing. We had to ask for room to be made up, drinks in mini bar to refill and amenities. Once we checked in, that was it. Very underwhelming. Bit of a shock after we flew home to find the full bill for the stay removed from the credit card while the “hold fee” which was also the full stay rates and the deposit had been removed from our credit card. Several emails with NO reply at all and the money was returned 2 weeks after leaving Singapore. Beautiful hotel? yes, lovely and pleasant service when they are in front of you? yes, spectacular views and stunning hotel? yes, yes, yes.
Am I being picky or unrealistic? I don’t think so, Being forced to use the App which isn’t the best, having to ask for basic amenities to be restocked during multi day stay, having no personal touches during a milestone and then having billing inquiries not responded too is not comparable to any other 5 star hotel I have enjoyed. I would certainly recommend a night as a bucket list adventure, pay the big dollars to experience the pool and hotel.However as a multi day stay in my experience had no benefits, once you were checked in, that was it. Even checking out was just putting the room key in a mailbox type slot and being pointed to the taxi rank. Never had that type of “greet then forget/ignore” type of service from a 5 star hotel before.",Date of stay:
Yet another pleasant and enjoyable stay at MBS,"This is yet another year we booked ourselves a stay with MBS to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We must say their services have again lived up to our expectations. We are super grateful to Ms Nicole Lee and her team who helped us facilitate our booking and their thoughtfulness in arranging the amenities (noting that we have two young kids) really made us feel at home... Their service staff and reception staff are very cheerful and respectful and kept checking on us if we needed help with anything. A pleasant incident we experienced at RISE restaurant for our breakfast where their staff (upon seeing us with young kids) offered their help with our food have shown their professional hospitality attitude.
The room we had is fabulous - clean and neat, spacious with a very mesmerising city view.. it was so comfortable that our kids refused to leave the room...

All the meals were really scrumptious with a lot of options to choose from. Particularly had a nice dinner at Wakuda and the Wagyu Yaki Udon exceeded my expectations, along with the Ora King Salmon Maki. Food came really quickly and staff had an excellent service attitude.

The stay was made pleasant by the service of two butlers, Danial and Ronnie.

They were fast and efficient, and very attentive to detail. Nothing was too much trouble for them, and they went out of their way to assist with all the requests to ensure that my stay was comfortable.

The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed, with all the amenities we needed for a comfortable stay.

What impressed us the most, however, was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff. They were always friendly, courteous, and went out of their way to ensure that our stay was enjoyable.

I must say that our experience at MBS hotel was truly exceptional. The room upgrade made our stay even more incredible and it added this once-in-a-lifetime experience for my husband, together with our young kids on my husband’s birthday.

Fantasy Rules!!!,"The place is enormous! Everything is very grand. It's pricey as you would expect but it's a world unto itself. The pool is such a delightful time but make sure you go early or during check out time to get a lounge by the pool. The views can not be described you have to see it to believe it. We stayed in Tower 3 but all towers have amazing views. What we didn't like were some rules they had about what shoes men could wear to the restaurant by the pool. Men can not wear sandals, even expensive ones but the ladies could. And this was just to get a drink. The hostess was not very gracious in explaining this to us and she was difficult to understand. It left a bad first impression on us as we just arrived. What saved this visit were the light and water shows, the views, beautiful rooms and the wonderful concierge Din. He spent so much time planing our time there and made every effort to make our stay fun and found the kind of places we were most interested in. The mall attached to the hotel is also a maze of shops and food court. The food there is just OK, better to go to China Town. I don't recommend Little India for a visit. It felt unsafe (saw a drug deal right in front of us) and very dirty. Stay around the hotel where there are many food options. It's quite the experience.",Date of stay:

Ben is the instructor that has being teaching and guiding me in calisthenics strength and conditioning with patience and knowledge.

Amazing experience,"Our experience at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel was out of this world.
It was my husbands 60th birthday and they upgraded our room to a Premier Suite with a city view from the room we had booked.
The suite was incredible, never seen anything like it.
We were shown to our room by the guest relations lady called Honey who was amazing, she explained every little detail of the room and how everything worked. Honey was so efficient, friendly and welcoming.
The hotel arranged for a bottle of wine, chocolates and birthday cake to be delivered to the room which was a beautiful experience.
Nothing was too much trouble and Honey kept in contact with us during the stay, making sure everything was ok.
Everyone should have an experience at this hotel.",Date of stay:
Superb hotel,"Overall feedback, the hotel is very good in every aspects.

It's all about the pool!,"Was expecting great things from this hotel.

Had wanted to stay here since hearing about it's reputation and from people who've stayed here.

Our room whilst nicely appointed and had a stunning view over the city was I thought a little underwhelming for the price (we paid about $AUD 860) and didn't include breakfast.

If you stood at the end of the corridor next to our room you could have another great view so dragging a chair out there is a good idea.

A large part of it's appeal is THE (rooftop) pool! I had to experience this as it's well promoted and didn't disappoint. There were plenty of people taking advantage of it at the time but it wasn't crowded which was great. The views over the city are stunning but it was lightly raining that day and was ""freezing""! About 19/20 oC! I was still going to enjoy it though. There are some shops up there but I didn't have a good look at them and think that they were just bars/cafes. They had lifeguards that were in the water constantly presumably so that if they have to ""rescue"" someone they can do so quickly. Easily spotted by their wetsuits.

At the ground level there were a lot of shops and restaurants but also had an escalator that took you to the shopping centre across the road. Allow plenty of time to get around it as there's a number of floors and the food court alone was a 15-min walk.

Great place to stay. Would do so again.",Date of stay:
Short Luxury Stay,"We spent 3 nights at the MBS on the way home from Thailand. Nice newly renovated room on a high floor with Garden views.

The room was a good size and well appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable. The balcony had great sunrise views over the water, but you could also see the supers grove and watch the nightly lightshow(and even hear the music that it was set to).

Staff were very friendly and helpful.

The pool has fantastic views and there were water and sunscreen stations. I personally found the pool area too crowded, as this is a bucket list item for a lot of people so lots of people in the pool taking photos..it was even more crowded on the weekend. Even at 10pm there were lots of people in the pool. It is a great experience though and the staff always managed to find is deck chairs even when it was busy.

We are at Bread Street in the Shoppes and also Spagos on the Skygarden level. Both different, but great food and service. We also had room service breakfast one morning, which is a great experience not to be missed.

I used the gym every morning. Good gym, staffed and usually busy at 7:30am but had everything you need.

Minor issues, but in our opinion the drains smelt, even on level 39. The smell seemed too come from the floor drain in the toilet and also in the shower. It also took a long time for the hot water to heat up in shower and sink. Minor gripes but people could find the drain smell off-putting.

We’ve stayed in lots of hotels in Singapore over the years but this was the most luxurious, but be prepared to pay big $$$ for it.

Well located on top of Bayview station to get around.

If you want a luxury stay and are prepared to pay for it, this place is highly recommended.",Date of stay:
"Marina Bay Sands, a place well worthy of your bucket list","It was 2010 when I first visited MBS. Since then, our family always visits Singapore at least twice a year and stays at the same hotel. Thank you for remembering us after all these years.

Every stay at your property has been superb. But our most recent stay was out of this world! We particularly appreciated the extra-attentive treatment as we were introducing our friends to stay with MBS for the very 1st time. This started with the complimentary limousine pick-up service the moment we landed at the airport; followed by being greeted at the hotel by the guest relation ambassador, Pauline Alcazar who guided us through the in-room check-in service.

Our friends loved, above all, the rooftop infinity pool, where our kids spent hours enjoying the sun and the poolside snacks. (Please try out the chocolate chip cookies!)

Our newly renovated room was located in Tower 2, mid-floor. Loved it! Absolutely the best angle to watch the 8pm lightshow! And even though it was a short 3d2n stay, our kids took so much advantage of the in-room dining and walking across to the main shopping mall.

On our last day, guest service gave us an extended checkout time so that the kids could enjoy an afternoon swim before we headed to the airport. The amazing guest service crew, Honey Casquejo arranged a limousine to drop us off at T4.

Everything at MBS, including the staff (especially Michael Lee who leads the Concierge and Guest Services) once again created unforgettable memories for me, my family and now also my friends, who have already started planning their next trip to MBS.",Date of stay:
If you don’t spend your money on Marina Bay Sands your children and grandchildren will so just do it.,"This building has become the icon of Singapore for good reason. We stayed 2 nights as a end of holiday treat. Check in was busy but easy. We got a level 33 room with stunning views over the gardens and out to sea across to Batam. Well worth spending the extra for the room. It was big and very well appointed. All the staff are courteous and helpful. The pool on the roof is amazing but does get crowded. I found early morning swim best to avoid all the instagram wannabe models posing for photos but each to their own . Personally I wanted to enjoy it for myself rather than convincing the rest of the world how much of a good time I was having. But yes I have to admit to taking a selfie by the edge of the infinity pool. We had the breakfast buffet on the roof top which was up there with the best of them. All the choices you could ever want. The area around the hotel is good with plenty of attractions within walking distance.
Yes it was the most expensive hotel room I have ever booked but yes it was good and yes I would recommend that you do too.",Date of stay:

But the pool- OMG, it is phenomenal- spending time there is heavenly!!! Having a three course lunch at Spago (with wonderful waiter Mark) is top notch.
But we must give a shout out to the most wonderful concierge Din, he was so very patient solving our dilemma and making sure our stay was so special. He is a valuable asset to this hotel!",Date of stay:
Breathtaking in so many ways,"This iconic building gave us a fantastic holiday experience, we loved every moment.
The location is excellent for easy walking access to all the Marina's attractions and Gardens by the Bay.
Welcome by the porters and reception staff was personal, friendly and efficient. Each member of staff we met added extra value to our stay by their helpfulness, care and concern for our welfare.
Our room was large, beautiful, well maintained and furnished in contemporary style, the bathroom similarly so and impeccably clean. We had a super view of the harbour and Gardens by the Bay.
Breakfast was a delightful experience, high quality, buffet style, lots of choice, attentive service.
Check out was swift and a pleasant experience.
One cannot visit this hotel without being thrilled by spending time at the top floor swimming pool, so big, warm and welcoming, lots of sun loungers and what a view - wow!
The design of this architectural master piece is a joy to behold and the foresight that went into developing this amazing holiday experience is quite phenomenal and so impressive.",Date of stay:

Average - style over substance?,"I paid the fee to be an additional guest in a room during a recent stay so that I could use the hotel pool facilities. I thought the pool was great and a fun place to be, despite it clearly being a instagram spot where everyone was focused on getting the perfect picture. The pool drinks service was great and my server Christy was very personable and attentive.

Overall the pool is fun and a great place to hang out. However, the hotel is really busy in felt like I was back in Las Vegas. It’s a very impersonal experience and you are just one of many people staying there. We were told that on one of the days they were expecting around 1000 new check-ins. This felt like the case. The general hotel areas were busy and there were people and suitcases etc everywhere. I was so glad to be just using the pool and retreating to the Ritz at the end of the day.

To be fair it depends what you are after. I think this hotel is style over substance. If you want the pool then great. If you want a high end personalised service then stay somewhere else.",Date of stay:

Remember he has over 4,000 people here to deal with on a daily basis. Din took the time to stay with us and resolve our ticket dilemma- service extraordinary. Room over looks skytree tops so we can view display at night. It is just wonderful. We can’t wait to head poolside- the infinity concept at this height is breathtaking",Date of stay:
Nice stay,"We recently stayed for 2 nights (3 days).

Like most other reviewers we came to experience the pool and the view from the pool.

We arrived around 10:00am and we did have to queue at the check-in counter for perhaps 30mins - not sure why it seems to take so long to serve each guest. Our room was not ready - which did not surprise us - but we were given temporary cards to use the facilities.

Luckily we had packed our swimwear in hand luggage, so we went straight to the pool deck and changed. There were plenty of lounge chairs available - however no surprise the ones with a little shade were all taken. The pool is spectacular & water is a lovely temp. There seemed to be limited places in this area to get a photo of the city buildings - without the pool/all the people in the pool - unless you're actually in the water. You can get an unobstructed photo/view the other way towards the harbour - but otherwise the observation deck is the best option.

Reception contacted us by email/WhatsApp around 2:30pm to let us know our room was ready. Luckily we did not have to queue again to receive our permanent keys.

We were on 41st floor with Harbour View Room - the view was great. Our room was lovely, king sized bed & large bathroom, with good selection of toiletries and a huge TV - but as would be expected from a 5 star hotel.

We found all the staff to be friendly - always saying hello etc.

Breakfast we had down on lobby level at Rise - extensive selection. We waited for approx 10 mins each day to be taken to a table (both days this was after 9:00am).

Checkout was at 11:00am - which was seamless. We were not leaving Singapore until later that night so Valet rep came and grabbed our suitcases for safekeeping. Another staff member approached us in the queue, took our keycards and told us all done. However we went back & checked & spoke to another lady who then provided us with temporary cards to enable us to use the facilities until we were getting picked up later that night. We did not know this option was available to us, otherwise we would have packed our swimwear etc in our hand luggage.

We did visit the observation deck later in the early evening with these temporary cards - so they did come in handy.

It's a very busy hotel - the staff try hard to make it not so impersonal but it does seem a little that way. We did enjoy our stay here - but don't believe it's value for money.",Date of stay:

Completely Different than My Last Visit...Exceeded All Expectations!!!,"My family recently (October 2023) stayed Marina Bay Sands (MBS). This was my second stay at MBS (my first was in July 2018), and the level of service my family and I experienced far excelled the service I received during my last visit. Following my 2018 visit, I thought my stay at MBS then was amazing and their service quality was solid (I stayed in one of their Club Rooms then). I could not imagine that the level of service could've improved - but it did!

We chose to stay in one of their newer Family Suite Rooms, and we took advantage of the Family Escapade Package. We were a family of three and we appreciated the extra space, and additional bedroom we had in the suite. The extra touches the suite had with respect to the free snacks for children, in-room books to read, keepsake back-pack, and plush Rori the Lion were nice additions and perfect for our 16.5 month old son.

I would like to especially call-out Ms. Jemcy and her Premium Services Team for making our stay memorable! Ms. Jemcy and her team made everything about our stay very easy. From arranging airport transfers, transport to/from a family photoshoot away from the hotel to arranging late check-out -- they took care of us from the moment we cleared immigration and customs to when we checked-in for our departing flight. Yes, there was also a team at Changi Airport to help with arrival and departure! I thought that the Premium Services Team's use of WhatsApp to communicate service requests was very smart, and it was convenient. I also really appreciated the in-room check-in and in-room check-out that we got, so there was no need to line-up in the queue at all. We were met at the Hotel Entrance when we arrived at the hotel and escorted straight to our suite. When we left, the team was outside our door for a bill review, to help with our luggage, and to make sure we had everything & didn't forget anything in the room.

What was really touching for me and my family was the gift our family was presented with from Ms. Jemcy and her team when we checked-out. We were genuinely surprised and touched!

At the end, my family and I were sad to leave! Ms. Jemcy and her team made everything so easy, all my family and I had to do was create memories to cherish in the years to come.

Thank you again and our family looks forward to staying at MBS again!",Date of stay:

The housekeeping staff was very friendly. She greeted and smiled to us. She also asked us if we need more teabags, bottled water or toiletries. We felt the service level was much better compared with last time during covid time.

A team that have clearly seen hospitality as a career and were AMAZING, without a doubt the best hotel experience we have ever had.

You could not help but be impressed by the Attention to Detail, the Skill oh and the ATTENTION TO DETAIL of this team!!!!

Amazing Staycation because of Matthew!,"I had the pleasure of being assisted by Matthew Bartholomeusz during my recent staycation at Marina Bay Sands, and I must commend him for his outstanding service. Navigating the carpark was a daunting task for me as it was my first time driving to MBS. Matthew not only provided clear and calm directions but also went above and beyond to ensure I found my way to the reception.

What stood out to me was his unwavering dedication to guest satisfaction. Not only did he guide me to the reception, but he also personally escorted me all the way to my room, His professionalism and genuine willingness to assist truly made my stay memorable and delightful.

I am incredibly grateful for Matthew's exceptional hospitality and impeccable service. Marina Bay Sands is undoubtedly fortunate to have such a dedicated and courteous staff member.

We already had a different hotel but we woke up on a Friday and there was availability at this property. I went and booked the hotel, given it was the F1 weekend we were just happy to be at the hotel and enjoy the infinity pool and the food.

When we arrived (earlier than check-in time) they surprised us with an upgrade to their new renovated rooms. If you go, please make sure you book this room, it was unbeliavable. Anything you might need you will find it within the room, no need to request anything else.

The infinity pool is of course amazing, but so is the food at the rooftop.

If I ever go back to Singapore, I'll make sure I only go If I have a Marina Bay Sands room for my whole stay.",Date of stay:

We were queueing for check-in but they moved us over to the VIP check-in (possibly because I am heavily pregnant).

We also got a new hotel room this time which is more luxurious than the rooms we stayed in pre-renovation. The bathroom facilities are much better and the general amenities have improved too.

Their operations seem to have improved too - the concierge actually came up to our room at check out time to wait outside and help with luggage. We also had great service from the Premium Services team - Shataz in particular helped us with pre-arrival admin, showed us to our room and gave us a room tour, arranged my birthday dinner at Spago, and even helped us with our valet parking arrangements.

We were personally escorted to our room on the 47th floor, tower 3 and shown everything. Note there is a separate reception for Tower 3. We could watch the Gardens by the Bay light show from the room and balcony. Balcony is only big enough to stand. The view was spectacular overlooking the gardens and harbour. The infinity pool was a highlight. Not crowded, right temperature and spectacular view. Food and drinks can be ordered, via QR code, from the sun lounges.

"MBS, which is the best choice for accommodation outside of the building itself","It was a perfect hotel that gave me a fantastic experience in Singapore, which I visited as part of my honeymoon.

During my honeymoon 13 years ago, this memory of staying in the MBS under construction when I was staying at the Mandarin Hotel and Ritz-Carlton made me feel a sense of change and subtle emotions.

As part of my birthday and honeymoon reminder, MBS, which I visited with my children this time, was a perfect hotel that gave me a fantastic experience in Singapore.

1. It is the best location located at the center of all Singapore's landmarks and tourist attractions, and it is connected to the subway, and it has become a landmark in itself, making it a pride to stay here.
2. The world-famous MBS' roof-top swimming pool was itself a landmark of Singapore.
3. It was kinder than other lodging companies, and the staff's English was good to understand in perfect English unlike anywhere else.
4. Clean rooms, facilities, and various amenities are recommended for anyone.
5. If you sign up for MBS Lifestyle members in advance, you can charge some of the money used in malls and food courts with a reward, and it also has the detail that can be used after staying or in auxiliary facilities during staying.
6. If you can upgrade your ELITE membership like me, don't miss using the free ART SCIENCE museum and attractions.

It is a recommended hotel if you travel to Singapore.
If you simply look at it as a single landmark from the outside and look at the observatory, you can't enjoy even 10 percent of MBS.

The Tower 4 will also be built in a few years, so I'm thinking of visiting it again then.",Date of stay:
Not the exclusive experience we where expecting.,"Not Sophisticated a bit on par with a premier Inn
The room is very basic the bathrobes poor quality and poorly pressed. The toiletries not very good quality. The best thing was the huge TV only there was nothing to watch no Netflix and no Amazon.

The Front foyer was nothing short of madness you couldn’t distinguish between guests and the public everybody taking pictures and selfies for there social media.
Ever type of poorly dressed flip flop local you could imagine.

The selling point is the pool that’s if you can get into it, the water was to warm not refreshing at all 100s of social Medea ’ fools taking 100s of selfies in all kinds of poses you can imagine. Most people seem to stay only one or two nights and leave. Such a shame for such a beautiful iconic building. Without the madness in the foyer and with a little control it could be improved some people entered the lift without room keycards to see if they could gain scoot the upper floors and the pool area the security was so Poor.

Hotel management not visible anywhere the staff are delightful and helpful at all times. But we will never go back despite its position. Next time it’s the Fullerton Hotel for us.

We were disappointed with some of the dining experience - some staff and overall service were spikey and it was sometimes slow making it really poor value, given the food was good (but not outstanding). We did feedback a couple of examples when we were at the hotel, but it seemed to continue and was a little bitter taste for an overall great stay.

We felt great coming back to MBS when out and about , a sense of pride in some ways.",Date of stay:
Pricey but worth it!!,"Our hotel experience made our Singapore visit a trip we’ll always remember. We stayed for 2 nights, and there were so many things to do in and around the hotel grounds for free. Super trees (don’t miss the light show), the Skypark, the Spectra sound and light show in front of the bay, and the rooftop infinity pool was amazing. And all the hotel location made it very easy to see the big sites of Singapore and come back to the hotel to rest from the heat when needed.

The hotel staff made us feel like royalty: Joan was so helpful with activity & meal recommendations, Roselyn was so amazingly accommodating and professional at the fitness center (and Uma, too!), and our bellman, Yezar, was very impressive during checkout making sure we had our many bags taken down on time and ready for our transport.

Amazing experience that everyone should enjoy at least once in their life! So glad we stayed at the MBS!",Date of stay:

Wonderful Stay at Marina Bay,"Top-notch luxury hotel in Singapore!! The rooms and bathroom were very large, luxurious and comfortable. Our room stylist was extremely friendly and gave us additional amenities!! I would like to mention that the check in time was 3pm, but the staff were very kind and let us get our room as soon as possible. And allowed us to check out a bit late. The infinity pool was very fancy, we went there during daylight because it the weather was hot, and at night time for pictures with the amazing city view.

Slightly disappointing that we got the city view instead of the garden view (we will look forward the next time we stay at Marina Bay to get a garden view room). I also noticed that when we turned on the security chain on the door, and tested it by trying to open the door, the chain fell off, reducing the levels of security (although Singapore is very safe). Given the price of one night it would’ve been better if we got a breakfast included.",Date of stay:
Sweet Escapade at Marina Bay Sands,"The moment we entered in our room, we were welcomed with nice complimentary treats and had a quick tour on what to expect. We were delighted with how elegant and spacious the room was. We certainly had a stunning view from our room seeing both the Art Museum / Helix Bridge! It was above and beyond our expectation as the hotel was equipped with Salvatore Ferragamo and all other essentials were provided. The hotel is indeed surrounded with beautiful attractions and was an easy access. Everything were nearby our hotel: Gardens By the Bay, MBS shopping mall, Marquee and Casino (prepare to walk a lot).

THE INFINITY POOL
It was a lovely morning when we head to Infinity Pool and had nice breakfast at Spago. When one of the crew found out it was my birthday, I was surprised with mocktails and danced while serving. It doesn’t stop there, right when we got back to our room, I was surprised with a birthday cake! So much gratitude to the Infinity Pool Crew Christy and Dennis for making this one of the most unforgettable moment I have ever experienced and made my stay in Marina Bay Sands spectacular.",Date of stay:

Stay away from Marina Bay Sands Hotel!,"Expected an amazing stay with the nice architecture and location! The management ruined that!

Stayed there 2 nights and wanted to have drinks with friends at Spago's on the roof. We were held back at the entrance because management requires every person to hold a room key to enter from 57th floor tower 3 where we were staying. I told them we just need to walk to the restaurant but no we had to travel down to the 1st floor the take the tower 2 elevator to 55th floor then transfer to 56 floor elevator just to go to the entrance of the restaurant. Unbelievable! Mr. James Tan was very helpful whereas all the other personnel working there have no brains and they should not be allowed to work in the hospitality industry! Management has no clue their ridiculous rules are ruining future business.

Also at 11pm they allowed kids in diapers with their parents into the jacuzzi! REALLY! Management should instead have a sensible rule where kids are not allowed in the pool area after 9pm!",Date of stay:
Great experience,"I'd like to commend the receptionist, Joy and Crystal, for their exceptional professionalism and assistance during my stay. Their help added to the already impressive experience, which includes breathtaking views and other well-known amenities.
Moreover, during an unexpected incident at the food court, two security staff members provided invaluable support, although their names remained a mystery. I'm grateful for their quick response and assistance. A great stay thanks to the dedicated staff!",Date of stay:
"Iconic hotel that lives up to the hype. Amenities, service, quality are all top draw… and then there is the roof top…","This hotel comes with a high reputation and huge instagram following, and it met every expectation we had. The room have top quality, including a lounge setup, fantastic city view, huge TV, and large floor plan. Then the rooftop infinity pool and bar are awesome. With a large area meaning you always have space, even when busy, and trees growing within the walkways, you wouldn’t believe you are up in the clouds until you look over the edge! Amenities, service and price are five star, and you get what you pay for. It’s an iconic venue that lives up to the billing and must be on your wish list.",Date of stay:
Wonderful Stay,"Our second visit to Singapore and we had always wanted to visit this iconic hotel and it did not disappoint.We arrived early but one of the two rooms we had booked was ready so we were given access to it immediately which was great. Stunning views of the gardens by the bay and a beautiful room.
For us the pool was the big attraction and again it was just fabulous, we had food and cocktails which given where we were was pretty reasonably priced.
The breakfast was a big wow, everything and more that you might expect for breakfast. The only small negative was when we were checked out and waiting a bit for our pre booked taxi there are not a lot of seats!But absolutely loved our stay. A special mention for Alcher who was especially helpful tho all the staff were lovely.",Date of stay:
A view like no other!,"Truly a once in a lifetime experience! Stepping out and seeing the view from the infinity pool was a moment we will never forget, the night time view with the city lights is simply magnificent! If you are planning to visit Singapore this is a hotel not to be missed. The service is remarkable, the fragrance flowing through the air at this hotel is luxurious and sets the tone for what is to come. We made incredible memories here, thank you to all of the amazing staff who were gracious enough to allow us to check in early and provided exceptional service throughout our stay!",Date of stay:
Great stay for the GP,"Lovely hotel rooms. Spacious, spotless, great views all round. Great location with a bridge to get to the track. We stayed for the Singapore GP which meant it was extra busy so all the restaurants were booked up and getting a drink in the bar(s) was a bit of a fuss. The hotel is so large you don't feel like you get any benefits for being a hotel guest, we had to queue several times just to have a drink. It sounds ridiculous given the size of the hotel and vast array of restaurants, but the hotel would benefit from a bar for guests only to enjoy a nightcap. We tried to go to Ce La Vie one evening and it was $180 cover charge.",Date of stay:
Amazing,"This is an amazing place.

The mini bar has everything you need. The pool was great too.",Date of stay:
A sumptuous hotel!,"Though we only had cocktails on the top floor adjacent to the swimming pool, this felt like a stunning luxury hotel in which to stay. The waitstaff in the cocktail bar were super attentive and patient with our group, the mocktail (pictured) was refreshing and interesting.

Just a once in a life time experience. The new refurbished rooms are really, really amazing",Date of stay:
Excellent as expected,"The hotel view, facilities, and comfortable beds are worth the price!

My family and I decided to stay at the Marina Bay Sand Hotel as we would visit our favorite place, Garden By The Bay. As expected, they have excellent service and facilities. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful from pre-arrival to checking out. I also had a good stay and rest in the hotel. However, the most memorable highlight was the breakfast.

I chose Spago & Bar at Level 57, where I met Shahran, Aniel, and Jello. I shared that I had food allergies. They attentively helped me choose the menu and ensured all family members enjoyed breakfast.

I also told them that I needed good coffee to start my day. Surprisingly, the guys also told me they could make us cups of good. It was the perfect delicious coffee! They selected good coffee beans, and the staff had the proper technique! My family and I still talked about this experience at home.

Ultimately, I drank 3-4 cups of coffee and chatted with them, and they (and the coffee) made our day! The restaurant reception staff was strict, so I didn't expect to meet these helpful and warm guys. The food was lovely, as expected, but I doubt I would meet the attentive, courteous, and friendly service experience in other places in Singapore.",Date of stay:
Best experience we ever had with Marina Bay Sands,"My husband and I had our wedding at MBS and we have got to say it is the best decision to host our wedding at MBS. From the start of choosing location for our wedding and the in charge for us was Ms Rachel Ho who was literally one of the best that have been liaising with us with everything regards to our wedding. She was the sweetest and most patient person I have ever met and really want to thank her for assisting us with it as it was really not easy managing everything and we cannot thank her enough for everything that she has done for us! We are so thankful and lucky to have her for helping us!

Next we would love to thank the premium service team especially Mr John and Mr Daniel Tuang for the exceptional and outstanding service!
Assisting us even before the actual wedding day itself! 1 day before the wedding they gave us a call and checked with us with regards to our programmed flow after our wedding, if we required assistance, if we required any parking car service for our personal vehicle as well as give us a run down of what to expect after the wedding which is something that I personally really appreciate, as I love to have things planned and known beforehand and them making that call gave me a lot of reassurance.

On the day itself Mr John and Mr Daniel Tuang assisted us with checking in of our rooms as well as the checking in of the additional rooms we have booked for our families which personally i felt that it was really sweet of them to do that for us. Not to forget the smooth procedure of getting our items and having them to be brought up to our rooms. During the 2 night stay they were excellent, checking in on us and making sure that we are so well taken care of that it made us want to come back again to experience the immaculate service that was provided to us! I cant express enough how excellent and great the service is except that Mr John, Mr Daniel Tuang and the premium service team really live up to the expectations of the world class image that people have of Marina Bay Sands. They are indeed a great asset to Marina Bay Sands and my husband and I would like to say thank the team for the excellent service down to even on the last touch point which is the check out day itself.

Mr Daniel Tuang personally came to assist us with the check out and not to forget about helping us to get a vehicle service to send us back home. That was really a lovely touch at the end of the whole stay as that personal touch jsut shows how much detailed and personal service the team has for their guest! Would definitely recommend to people the excellent service given by the premium service team.",Date of stay:
"""MUST DO"" when you visit Singapore.","My Sister and me stayed on Mid August 2023 in the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore.
We visited Singapore 20 years ago, and we wanted to see what changed.
And it was changed. A LOT. And from the BEST to THE VERY BEST.
It’s no wonder why the Marina Bay Sands became one of the symbols of Singapore.
After being in The Shangri-La Singapore (to be next to Orchard Road) we headed to the south of the city, and stayed for two days in the Marina Bay Sands, AND ITS IN ANOTHER LEVEL.
The hotel is spectacular, and from the moment that we arrived everything went smoothly, efficiently and with a smile.
We got our room with the City View, and ITS BREATH TAKING.
The room was pure luxury. Spacious and equipped with all the modern comforts you could wish for, with a HUGE Smart Samsung 4K TV screen, with lot of channels and connectivity options.
The bathroom is very spacious, with all the ordinary bathroom amenities, like tooth brush, tooth paste, etc. but in an enlarged sized and branded for the Marina Bay.
The rooftop pool - the Infinity Pool - offers a breathtaking panoramic view of Singapore's skyline, and is a MUST DO when you're a guest in the hotel.
Breakfast at the RISE restaurant is a delight. SPECTACULAR and has many options for every taste. Just try to come before 9AM to avoid the long waiting.
I must mention the speed and effectiveness of the entire hotel staff, from check-in to check-out, everything is done with a smile. Just a pleasure.
Of course, the nearby attractions - the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay and the shopping center - all of these only add to the pleasure.
Don't miss the symphony of lights held every evening at 8:00 p.m.
JUST FANTASTIC.
MUST COME AGAIN.",Date of stay:

The Marina Bay Sands Experience,"My stay at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore has been nothing short of spectacular.

First off, the hospitality was off the charts. From the moment we touched down, we were welcomed by their airport ambassador who assisted us with our luggages to our pre-arranged limousine ride.

We were then greeted by the hotel personnel who were already on standby at the hotel's porch waiting for our arrival and were escorted straight to our room to check-in.

As for our room, it was pure luxury. Spacious and equipped with all the modern comforts you could wish for. The attention to detail in the room decor was impressive.

We were given a Dyson hair dryer, Bvlgari soap, and shampoos, Bang and Olufsen speaker, and a leather safe with jewelry and a watch compartment.

All amenities can be requested through the TV in the room. There was a QR code card placed on the coffee table for contact purposes in case of any need for special assistance.

We have a very well-stocked mini bar. It was extensive enough to make your own cocktails (to which they have included a cocktail recipe book). They even provided us with dried orange slices.

And of course a cabinet full of goodies from assorted TWG teas, Nespresso capsules, Godiva chocolates, moon cakes, and beers to my girl's favorite Korean noodle and truffle chips.

Our room also comes with breakfast, high tea, and evening cocktails, an access pass for 2 to the ArtScience Museum, and a professional photoshoot at the iconic Infinity Pool in the sky.

The view from the room is also stunning, overlooking the Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, the Artscience Museum etc., which can all be accessed through the hotel itself.

The rooftop pool offers a breathtaking panoramic view of Singapore's skyline, especially during sunset.

We also went up to the observatory deck to get a glimpse of the panoramic city view.

DON'T PLAN YOUR SPECIAL OCCASION,"We have booked this hotel for one night on 4th Sep 2023, On which we were having our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We have already told to hotel prior making the reservations. At the time of Check-in I have confirmed the same thing asking for any arrangements from the Hotel side they simply refused and said they havent got such any information which was really annoyed us. They told us by evening we will arrange surprise for you, but nothing happens, we are still awaiting...

We have reached hotel at 12.45 pm in afternoon they would refused to give us the room as room has'nt ready and give temporary key for Observation Deck and told that they will give Email or Call after the room is ready, till 2.30 pm we haven't received any information then we go back to the reception and ask for the room. They said the room is ready for Check-in. So again feeling weird that they did'nt have any courtesy for the communication.

We have asked for to increase some hours for late Check-out but again they simply refuse and said only for 1 hr. Atlast, When I have shared our experience to hotel staff, they are giving the look totally blank.

In total the Iconic symbol of Singapore is not worthy to stay, its better to go on Observation Deck alone rather than to stay at this hotel.

How much are you willing to splurge?,"After having visited the Sky Park Deck on the hotel's 57th Floor, I decided to splurge and stay at the hotel to celebrate a special occasion. At check-in we were told they'd ""upgraded"" us to a ""better"" room but in a lower floor! There was a cake in the room, which is appreciated. The infinity pool on the 57th Floor is great and the main reason for our splurge - but getting there required taking 2 different elevators. The breakfast was good too. Rooms are definitely not worth the charges! And while I will grant them their hotel practice to not even extend the check-out by an hour (""We're fully booked"" but rooms were available online), I was upset at a charge for the included breakfast which would have gone unnoticed, and other guests have complained about this practice too. Something fishy about their accounting - I was asked to sign ""disputed charges"" statement seal that they stamped and had ready for such ""disputes"" on their invoice.",Date of stay:
A Dream Proposal Come True,"It can't be more true that the reputation of this hotel precedes it. Nice environment, quality rooms, and first class service by the highly professional staffs of this hotel.

My girlfriend (now fiancè) loves the marina bay area, so I chose MBS hotel to spring a surprise proposal. The proposal involved a quite a number of people and required a few factors for it to be a success. Even up to proposal day, I still had a number of uncertainties, which could have led to a huge fiasco if not for a few notable hotel staffs who helped me along the way:

Roshini, the front desk staff who is surprisingly still in training, shows passion, poise, skill, tactfullness and sensitivity beyond her years in the hotel industry. She was ever patient, very friendly and proactive to set into motion the requirements needed for my proposal to be a success. I think it was through her that the hotel got to know of my plans, which led to a cascade of valuable help. She will go very far if she maintains this valuable attitude. I wish her all the best.

Louise, a guest-relations officer and ambassador of the premier services, who was touched by my story and was so passionate, thoughtful, proactive, professional and alert in helping me. She was my extra pair of eyes to ensure my proposal went smoothly. Her services gave a very warm touch and and an extra element of delight into the execution the proposal, such as a cake, champagne and premium souvenir mugs to remember MBS hotel by. She even briefed her team about me so that her colleagues could help me in my time-sensitive endeavour in case she was not available (But she was available to help throughout). A true precious hidden gem among the strong team at MBS hotel.

Then there were also Pau and Allie who were so patient, helpful and warm in helping me to accomplish tasks that made the proposal all the more brilliant. I'm very thankful for all their great help.

In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, as i'm confident that they will be in good hands. Thanks MBS hotel.",Date of stay:
"Sick in Singapore, and MBS staff were amazing!","I was in Singapore on business and, unfortunately, I ended up having to stay in the room for several days because I got sick. As a result, I became very intimate and familiar with my room, moreso than I would've liked...

Luckily, the room itself was very nice with a balcony and a very comfy bed which I spent tons of time in. The staff were also amazing; they brought me anything and everything I asked for (tons of water bottles, food, kleenex, a humidifier, etc.) so I could get well. They even came up to my room to refill the humidifier for me upon request!

It is very depressing to be sick while away from home, but being so well looked after by the MBS staff and catered to made this unfortunate circumstance much more tolerable. Thank you for doing such a great job and making sure I had what I needed when I was unwell!",Date of stay:
Thank you for the unforgettable memories,"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands to propose to my girlfriend.
I started communicating with the staff about 3 weeks prior to our stay regarding the room decorations and bouquet preparations, and their quick response time made the process very smooth. To be honest, I was a bit nervous about preparing for the proposal because I was going to propose overseas and my English skills were not very good, but their support was excellent and once I started contacting them, I was able to proceed with the preparations with confidence.

Upon arrival at Marina Bay Sands, two staff members escorted us to our room. We were thrilled to find champagne and chocolates in our room. I think they took special care of us because we had told them of our plans to propose.
While we were in the room being briefed about our stay and the proposal, the other staff member was at a distance showing her around the room and chatting with her, which helped to camouflage the conversation about the proposal. It was a casual but attentive response.

I had planned to propose after dinner, but due to the combination of premium service hours and room departure time, I thought it would be difficult to accommodate such a request to have the room decorated during dinner. Therefore, I did not request room decorations in the end, but the staff was flexible and even decorated our room during dinner (we had communicated the room departure time and dinner time via whatsapp, in case you were wondering). What was supposed to be a surprise for her ended up being a surprise for me as well.
With the help of the staff, the proposal was a success and she was able to cry and be happy.

It was clear to me that Marina Bay Sands is supported not only by its great location, but also by the flexibility, thoughtfulness, and care of each staff member. Although I can't write it all down above, they also took care of many details for us. We will stay at Marina Bay Sands again after our wedding.

Finally, I cannot thank enough all the staff members who were involved in our stay, especially the two staff members who assisted us primarily with the proposal. Thank you so much.

彼女へのプロポーズのためにマリーナベイサンズに宿泊しました。
宿泊の3週間前ほどから部屋の飾りつけや花束の準備に関する連絡を取り始めましたが、スタッフのレスポンスが迅速だったこともあり、非常にスムーズに準備を進めることができました。正直なところ、海外でのプロポーズだったうえ、私の英語スキルも高くはなかったので、プロポーズの準備には不安を感じていたのですが、サポート体制が万全だったこともあり、連絡を取り始めた後は安心して準備を進めることができました。

マリーナベイサンズに到着すると、2名のスタッフが客室まで案内してくれました。客室にはシャンパンやチョコレートが用意されており、感激しました。プロポーズの予定を伝えていたため、特別に対応してくれたのだと思います。
客室で宿泊やプロポーズに関する説明を受けていたのですが、その間もう一人のスタッフが離れた場所で、彼女に部屋の案内や雑談をしてくれていたおかげで、プロポーズに関する会話をうまくカモフラージュすることができました。さりげない対応ではありますが、気配りを感じられました。

プロポーズは夕食後に行うことを予定していたのですが、プレミアムサービスの営業時間や部屋の出発時間の兼ね合いから、夕食中に部屋の飾りつけを行ってもらうというような対応は難しいと考えていました。そのため、部屋の飾りつけについては結局依頼をしなかったのですが、スタッフが柔軟な対応を行ってくれ、夕食中に部屋の飾りつけまで行ってくれました（一応部屋の出発時間や夕食時間はwhatsappで連絡していました）。彼女へのサプライズの予定が、私までサプライズされることになりました。
スタッフの皆さんにご助力いただいたこともあり、無事プロポーズは成功し、彼女には泣いて喜んでもらうことができました。

マリーナベイサンズは、ロケーションが良いこともさることながら、各スタッフの柔軟な対応や思いやり、気遣いによっても支えられていることがよくわかりました。ここには書ききれませんが、いろいろと細やかな対応も行っていただきました。結婚後にはまたマリーナベイサンズに宿泊しようと思います。

最後に、今回の宿泊に関わっていただいたスタッフの皆様方、特にプロポーズを主として補助していただいた2名のスタッフには感謝の念が堪えません。本当にありがとうございました。",Date of stay:
Amazing hotel but not sure I’d do it again,We stayed one night in the hotel. The good parts of it are the staff are fantastic. Friendly and very willing to assist. The room was clean and spacious with an amazing view of the city. And of course the rooftop pool is simply amazing. However the room was missing glasses and a few other items which was surprising. The bed was also very hard. Some people would like this but I prefer a softer bed. Overall it was a great stay however I don’t think I would do it again as I didn’t really think it was value for money.,Date of stay:
Stunning hotel and overall an amazing experience,"We have just returned from a super couple of days at MBS. We travelled in from our 2 week holidays in Thailand and this 2 nighters at MBS was going to be a fab way to end our wondeful holiday and the hotel didn’t disappoint. From the lobby to the infinity pool, to the shopping mall to the restaurants, this hotel is stunning. We were fortunate enough to be given two newly renovated rooms on floor 21 and our views were incredible. The rooms were faultless, stunning decor, all amenities. Given the huge price tag in this type of establishment, the kids were under strict instruction not to eat or drink anything in their room !! The prices for the cocktail bar in the room are outrageous !!
The breakfast buffet was amazing, busy ? Yes but amazing and impressive when you consider the size of this hotel. You need key cards to get everywhere and this is a good thing to avoid non guests in guest areas. The pool IS as breathtaking in real life as it is in the TV programmes and photos and honestly weirdly never saw it crowded despite visiting at various diff times of the day.
Note - there is construction work going on at the moment - the gym is closed so you need to walk over the road to the convention centre to that gym and you can see and hear a little the work going to on renovate other rooms on lower floors. There is a crazy busy road outside the hotel so I’m not sure how pleased I would have been to have been given a lower level floor - the views and noise must be pretty annoying if you were on say floors 5/6/7….
We went down to the mall to eat dinner and into places like Chinatown. Budgets didn’t stretch to the restaurant in the hotel ! (but we had breakfast included which was great !)
We used the concierge a couple of times and the ladies there were so helpful and friendly (big thanks to Adele who booked our transport to the airport).
Overall we were wowed by MBS which was exactly our hopes and intentions for our short visit.",Date of stay:
Perfect stay!,"One of the best hotels we stayed!
Great environment, great service, great rooms and very kind personal.

We especially want to thank Ms Glaiza Gonzales for making our stay a memorable one, especially for our son, who is an architecture enthusiast and aspires to become an architect. We received an amazing welcome and enjoyed many beautiful surprizes during our stay.

Disappointing but still worth it for the iconic pool experience,"Honestly, we were pretty disappointed with our stay here. We booked it as a final
Hurrah after a week in Singapore then a week Bintan island which were simply amazing. The first problem was nearly an hour checking in. Huge queues, it felt more like airport check in than a five star hotel. Compare this to where we stayed in Indonesia when you get ushered to a comfy sofa, given a
Cold face towel and welcome drink whilst they efficiently sort out your documents etc.
Marina Bay, ages standing, nowhere to sit, noisy. At check in they just seems to be endlessly tapping on the keyboard. Despite it being 6pm the rooms weren’t ready and we therefore missed our dinner reservation. When we got to the room there was no bed for our son. We were told he was expected to share the bed with us. A 9 year old with additional needs, he has to have his own bed. I then had to argue about an additional charge for a bed (bearing in mind you have paid £500+ for the room for one night. They eventually madding
‘Complimentary’. After complaining, we were allowed a late check out. So, we went to the pool. Then came down to find the key had been disabled. Had to queue again in reception in wet swimming stuff to get the key sorted. Then another very lengthy checkout process, 45 mins again.‘I just don’t know why it takes so long. The Premier Inn is better! The rooms themselves are nothing special either.
Carpets seemed musty and decor uninspiring.

Ok. Well now for the positives, as you can see from misting my reviews we are very positive people 😄. The pool area really is beautiful, and a chance for amazing pictures.

All staff were friendly throughout.
Conclusion- mass tourism not for us.",Date of stay:
Exceptional,"The hotel itself is amazing and the rooms are fabulous but the main feature are the staff! We arrived from our flight at 8.00am and the wonderful receptionist found us our room which was already made up so we could check in immediately.
The real star was the guest relations man, Din, who went above and beyond in helping us organise our brief time in Singapore. From advising us on attractions to booking tickets and organising our luggage for us he couldn’t have been more helpful and friendly. A big ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ to him. What an asset he is to the hotel!
Overall we couldn’t fault our stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel! A truly special place.

Singapore's Best Hotel!,"Marina Bay Sands is a hotel where luxury and quality meet. This hotel has become a symbol of Singapore, a small yet vibrant country. You must definitely stay at this hotel, which is compact but offers a lot. Especially in terms of hygiene, it's extremely satisfying. As a recommendation, make sure to use the infinity pool at the very top. Very soon, with the use of AI (artificial intelligence) technology, we will be adding our reviews to all travel platforms in a completely realistic manner.""",Date of stay:
August 2023,"Pros. The staff were the most attentive, friendly and helpful people I have ever met whilst staying in a hotel. Nothing was too much trouble, they were genuinely interested in our well-being and any request was done at lightening speed. Everyone (bar tenders, room service, waiters ect) were all so welcoming and happy. Considering the size of the hotel, I was pleasantly suprised that we got the type of personalised service you would expect in a small,boutique hotel. When arriving, I would recommend using the app check-in to avoid the airport length queues. The room was clean and the toiletries included were designer. We ate at the Spago restaurant which overlooked the pool (we requested an outdoor table) and the service and food was exquisite. Probably one of the best meals I have ever experienced. Although the area around the pool was busy, the pool never felt busy so there was plenty of room to swim and to take those all important selfies!

Cons. The bed and pillows were as hard as nails and it resulted in me getting hip pain for the following day. Although extremely spacious, the room was dated and very beige. It didn't look as 'sparkly' as it did in the pictures on the website. The majority of the restaurants which are advertised on the hotel's website are situated in the shopping mall so double check locations when booking. The outdoor pool is busy and beds go fast! We had to use two beds which were located in the water so there was no dry land around us to rest drinks on etc. When leaving, we got a taxi outside the hotel and it cost us $60 but had we booked it ourselves it would have costs $35 for the same journey.",Date of stay:
Incredible but you need deep pockets,"Stayed for one night on the way back to England and the place is breathtaking in scale, architecture, ambition, the list goes on. We booked the cheapest room which was still something like £650 a night and were told they didn’t have a high floor room as requested but could offer a comp upgrade to a suite but be aware it’s near where they are doing renovations and there would be some noise in the daytime which didn’t matter to us as we would be out.

The suite was breathtaking - bigger than the upstairs in my house, massive dining / living room, separate pool room / bar, massive double balcony, the list goes on.

We were on the 51st floor with amazing views and only 6 floors from the rooftop pool which was obviously amazing. It’s busy up there but lots of loungers and generally a really special place to be.

We ate at Ce La Vie the rooftop restaurant which fitted my general observations that high up restaurants are generally overpriced and not amazing food - dinner for 2 adults and 1 child with a single bottle of wine was £330 and absolutely unremarkable. Breakfast at the rooftop Italian restaurant was great though.

Location is obv great - walking distance to the Gardens and Avatar thing and all the shops.

This is a must stay location - if you can afford it !",Date of stay:
Amazing pool & average service,"It started with a long wait at arrivals desk as we noted that the price to pay shown was over 50% more than the reservation rate we were given at time of booking. Eventually sorted, no apology other than an explanation it was a computer issue. Room request for connected or adjacent rooms not met, not only that but one of our rooms wasn’t ready, after a very long flight this was also very frustrating.
Rooms were nice and clean and the view over the gardens was lovely.
The view from the pool is outstanding and in my opinion is the only reason to book this hotel.
Staff were courteous but there were too many people everywhere and the level of service was not as expected for the price range.",Date of stay:
Marriage Proposal Accommodation Experience,"Like a dream, I actually fulfilled an important task in my life - marriage proposal in the most beautiful Sands Hotel in Singapore Manager Daniel has been confirming the details with me from whatsapp, and also helped arrange balloons and roses.

Amazing Birthday Stay at MBS,"My family spend a night at MBS for my wife’s birthday. In addition to the amazing room charges, Charmaine, John, Dyana and team service was Superstars. Despite some minor hiccups along the way, everything far exceeded our wildest expectations. Started with the exceptional room size, layout, views on both sides & outstanding comfort, complete with all birthday frills especially the lush bouquet and strawberry cake & champagne; followed by making full use of the 1 day plus stay (thru their kind courteous extension & complimentary valet parking) to go to the mall several times yesterday, had a long morning boardwalk walk, visited the Flower Dome and enjoyed a well reserved sumptuous buffet lunch at Rise.

All the staff are incredibly friendly, efficient and obviously well trained. Shout out to Din Mahamud in the Concierge department and Guest Service agent – Yancy for taking care of us.

"Over priced, if your not a millionaire don’t go as your treated like your not important.","Prices are astronomical, get way more for your money elsewhere in the country with just as high standards. Can’t even get in any of the restaurants on site. Charge another 18% on top of already expensive room. Clear prioritise for more important guests. Pool and location only good bit.",Date of stay:
Best in singapore,5 out of 5 best hotel in singapore . They have sky lounge infinity pool plus shipping area also in the hotel .. you can view whole Singapre . I was with my family . Nice staff .. friendly . If plan singapore you must stay at lest one night in this hotel and do go any where,Date of stay:
Faultless service but just too large and too many people,"Big. Grand. Everything large scale. Service wise impeccable. Staff give lots of effort to keep customers satisfied. Just too large scale and people everywhere. Especially the iconic pool. Credit the hotels’ ingenuity for hiring photographers to help solo travelers like me had some instagrammable photos (albeit at a price🤣)

Room is faultless. Just a bit old school like those five star hotels in the 90s, which is strange considering it opened in the 2010s. Food is decent. Lots of choice, including some fine dining ones.

Check in feels like at the airport. Again too many people. Staff tried to clear the queue ASAP but people kept coming. Must be stressful handling this all day.

Breakfast is good. If you choose Rise restaurant at lobby, be sure to get there before 9 am. Otherwise expect a super long queue. Prefer Spango on the 57th floor. It opens at 7am though.

The gym is, unbelievably far away from the room I stayed (tower 3). A long walk plus a traffic light will get you there. It’s located at the convention centre instead of the hotel! The good news is you get some warm up exercise😂

Overall you cannot fault the service of their staff. Plus it’s almost a no brainer if you want to watch fireworks of the National Day Parade. Still that one day I took away was because of its large scale, which made this hotel always crowded and lacks exclusivity essential for a luxury hotel.",Date of stay:
Disappointing,A great looking building. Very expensive for an ordinary room. Foyer is massive but crowded. Impossible to get a meal in any of the retaurants as they were booked out every evening. Cheaper to get a good hotel on Orchard Road and eat really good food in Chinatown.,Date of stay:
Il you can afford it do it!,"Great hotel for our first time to Singapore. It may be expensive but it’s close to the main attractions (garden bay, supertrees, great walks in the park). Offers great views over the city from the terrace at the 57th floor. The swimming pool is awesome and is only accessible to hotel guests (visitors from outside the hotel are not allowed!).
Room: many types, different prices. Higher floor have better views. Our room was high floor with great view over the harbour.
Breakfast: you can have breakfast either at the restaurant on the ground floor or on the terrace at the 57th floor. The restaurant on the ground floor has an infinite choice of dishes from all over the world and practically any kind of fruit imaginable. yes, there was a queue but in about five minutes we were seated. the restaurant at the top has a limited choice of food, but it is outdoors, great views and no queue. So the choice is up to you.
I highly recommend this hotel for your first day in Singapore.",Date of stay:
WOW,"This hotel has to be seen to be believed. Just the sheer architecture of its amazing.
Service, Food and Drink is top notch. Infinitely pool on the Roof is jaw dropping. Stunning. That’s without the Gardens which night time show is mind blowing. Loved this hotel and Singapore. Worth the money and ratings.",Date of stay:
AMAZING resort,"AMAZING resort!

From the moment you arrive, top quality and efficiency are the key words. The warm and friendly service is just P-E-R-F-E-C-T not to say Exceptional, Outstanding… even more if you consider the giant size of the property, number of rooms and guests!

Therefore, to congratulate the MBS teams, I thought they deserved a detailed review!

Let’s start from the beginning:

* Check in: fast and efficient, you can accelerate the process through pre-check in achieved from the MBS app. Bagage are delivered efficiently, so that you can quickly get ready for going to… the swimming pools ;-)
* Swimming pools: of course, this is THE world-famous attraction of the resort! Views on the city skyline, day or night, are just amazing!!! Water temperature is warm, small detail but I liked it… Pool service, that you can order from the app or to the numerous pool attendants, is REALLY fast and efficient. Food is good, not too pricey. Cocktails are OK, though could be more alcoholic to my taste ;-)
* Rooms: we booked a Deluxe King Sky View. As you can expect from its name, you will get a top-floor level (50 out of 57 for us). The room is quite big (around 39 sqm), extremely clean, modern and well designed, with a large bathroom at the entrance (1 shower+1 sink+ restrooms), a large king bed (pillows were a little bit too tough to my opinion - maybe a pillow menu could be a recommendation), and a salone, facing the bay, with floor-to-ceiling windows. Day or night, hard to stop watching such views…
* Room service: again, it was fast (meal was delivered within 10’ after being ordered, though it was 4.00am) and efficient (we ordered easily from the TV). Quality of the food was very good.
* Restaurants: though they could be pricey to very pricey (we tried Wolfgang Puck’s restaurants such as Spago and Cut, as well as Mott 32), you can also experience less pricey restaurants in the shopping mall galeries (we had a traditional singaporian breakfast there for around 15SGD for 2). To go back to the restaurants we tried, all were excellent (the Waggyu tasting menu at Cut is a must), with a very nice and intimate decor.
* Shopping: very clean, with all the luxury brands you could be looking for, with less high-end stores too.
* Casino: as I was traveling with my 16-y/o son, we were not allowed to enter the Casino.
* Check out: no surprise, it was fast and efficient. The warm and friendly staff was helpful to store our luggage before leaving the resort.

To conclude: this was an AMAZING stay, with an exceptional service level thanks to a great and friendly staff. I can’t wait returning there in the future!",Date of stay:
BEST BUTLERS EVER.,"We arrived at the hotel quite early as our flight landed early in the morning. At first, they weren't able to do early check-in and didnt have our rooms ready on time. However, they've upgraded our rooms and even got a butler for us. The stress of waiting for our rooms was most definitely compensated by the service of our butlers that day - Paulo and Amin. No words. Just incredible. They took care of us in such a way that we decided to come back next month again. We felt so special and so relaxed as everything was taken care of for us. From the table reservations, to the personal cabana's by the pool, to the room service, to picking us up and escorting us, and they even organised a personal chauffer to take us to the airport. EVERYTHING. Without them, we wouldnt have been able to enjoy all the in credible things that staying at Marina Bay sands offered. This includes all the !!delicious!! food inclusions and reservations that came with our reservation! Paulo and Amin's service have more than made up for the delayed rooms. They were polite without making us feel boring, utterly knowledgeable without making us feel dumb, respectful but still lightened the room with their positive attitude, and most importantly, they tailor-made all the services to best cater our needs and expectation of our stay. They went above and beyond! We travel quite frequently and have been on hotels around the world, but I have to say, our stay at Marina Bay Sands was elevated and one of the best we've ever had.",Date of stay:
Nice but could be better,"The view was outstanding ,but the access control is way exaggerated. Literally you can stay on small area with plenty of people. I do not understand why they do not let people to see their pool nor to enter in it. I think booking would work. Same story with restaurants and bars. On national day rehearsal this place was not simply closed, but blocked by police, no one could enter neither go out. I find it inhuman.",Date of stay:
"Great views, easy access to the city","The top floor has breathtaking views and an infinity pool. The pool area gets crowded during the day, but there is an area for only hotel guests. The service is great, rooms are nice, and location is only 20 minutes from the airport. The hotel is adjacent to the gardens - make sure you ask for a garden view to see the light show from your room if you don’t want to walk 10 minutes to the garden or if you want a different view of the show.

Downside is that the restaurants on the roof are overpriced and just ok regarding food. We ate at Lavo. Origin and bloom at the base of tower 3 was a great stop for breakfast or lunch.",Date of stay:
Amazing,"Everything was amazing!. Exactly the two butlers that served us, Paolo and Amin. The serves was great, the food and the accommodation was great. Couldnt of asked for a better service or place to stay, and we would like to come back and I wish these two butler they be assigned again thanks you guys!!",Date of stay:

On the ceiling of Singapore,"Great place to be. Amazing view of Singapore, do make sure that you booked in advance because it can get really difficult to secure the spots at sundown. The day we went was cloudy so we couldn't see but only a glimpse of the sundown..
Beware you won't be allowed in the bar, it is only for the hotel guests.
You can only buy overpriced drinks at a small booth on the roof.",Date of stay:
Compelling experience and stay,"As a tourist in Singapore, it's pretty much a given that you have to stay here at least once. We did that, stayed for only 1 night in a city view room. We booked a deluxe room but got upgraded to a sands premier room. The check in was smooth in tower 1, the lobby is humongous, like an airport terminal. We did not get a chance to eat any of the hotel restaurants but there was easy access and paths to the mall. The taxi drop off and pick up was smooth in tower 1.

We stayed in tower 2, 21st floor in a renovated sands premier room. It was great, very opulent and grand decor, and of course all clean and new. The room and bathroom were huge, closets are ample, double sinks with tub and shower, and the powder room is a nice touch. City views are amazing but yeah, the afternoon sun hitting the room is killer. The elevator to the infinity pool was out so we had to go back down to lobby to tower 1 elevator. Yes the pool is an experience, and I think mornings are best before the sun / heat get crazy. We checked out but got keycards to go back up to the pool as we had a late flight. Bottom line, the hotel is expensive, it's a splurge, but it's worth it, and next time we will stay longer.",Date of stay:
Best view in SG,"Had a great experience. Wonderful location. The view from the rooftop infinity pool is like nothing else. However, feels like its become more of a tourist attraction than a five-star hotel, which is quite disappointing considering the price. Overall it is still a must-stay if you're visiting Singapore for the first time.",Date of stay:
80%,"On the plus side, the hotel offers breathtaking views of the city skyline and convenient access to many of Singapore's main tourist destinations. The space is a tad dated, though. The cost of the hotel's restaurants and other amenities made it difficult to take advantage of everything it offered.",Date of stay:
Out of this world!,"We visited for two nights/three days end July 2023 and were lucky enough to be there for Singapore day rehearsals which saw jets & fighter plane displays, a flag fly by and evening fireworks it elevated the experience of the pool to super heights!
We were awake early for sunrise (6-45am) on the pool deck and it was spectacular, you practically get the roof to yourselves (granted there are some hardy folk there too) but set your alarm and go up and watch the day break and use the pool and hot tubs alone. You can go back to bed if you wish!
We visited on our home leg from Oz back to UK with two teens and two adults so we needed two rooms. Yes it was expensive (£2,700GBP) for Friday - Sunday inc breakfast (had a late checkout on one room for the Sunday due to late flight) but it 100% worth spending just to be in that pool! Even if you only book one night, do it! We managed to get interconnected rooms so that was good for our needs. Rooms have complimentary use of minibar refilled daily (soft drinks/water/crisps/snacks) that was nice. they provided a birthday cake for my daughters birthday too (3 infact lol) def made her feel special!
Rooms are fantastic as should be expected we chose to look over the gardens view but either that or city view are fabulous all lit up at night. (but you see the city view from pool) Garden View from Hot Tubs. The pool bar does food/snacks and drink and to be honest weren’t ridiculously overpriced- expensive but okay for where you are. HUGE hotel complex with the Shoppes and outside it’s truly huge. Rise Breakfast buffet was fabulous and plentiful but BE EARLY by 9/9.30am they were queuing 40 deep. Get there early no queues. It’s actually in the foyer which is weird, but feels okay when seated. they have everything from American, European and Asian breakfast option pretty much everything any culture would need (and some)!
We stayed at Tower 3 my only gripe was we checked in 1.30am on Friday and by 2.30am our cases hadn’t arrived so I had to phone down from room but within 15mins they were there and very apologetic. But being that hour and after a long flight from Australia we just wanted to sleep.
Singapore its self if hot/humid (July) but fabulous, such a green city. Recommend the Gardens by the Bay - we loved Floral Fantasy the best as SO pretty but all the Cloud Forest/flower dome etc are air conditioned so a god send from the heat. Hoponhopoff Bus goes from outside hotel so that was good. We did Red & Yellow line full loop before getting off and exploring stops then.
Def will come back to Singapore and would probably stay here again!",Date of stay:
"Amazing rooms, with best views of the SG Marina area stop the infinity pool","The best hotel I’ve ever stayed at!

Top quality,"This hotel is on another level! Room equips with all toiletries complementary water tea coffee and snacks. Bath robes and slippers also available.

We headed to the infinity pool adorning the bath robes and slippers the views are just breathtaking and service second to none.

We visited blossoms restaurant while to food was amazing the staff got on my nerves as soon as you lift the fork to your mouth for the last bite they whip your plate away, they also provide a wet wipe and nuts to your table and charge them to your bill whether you wanted them or not !

But when you have families staying at an overpriced hotel and to wash the kids clothes cost me over 500 dollars and there is no self laundry option… I would give it a zero.

Wonderful hotel in Singapore,"Marina Bay Sands is a wonderful and iconic hotel in Singapore, close to the Convention Centre and Shopping Centre with the same name. The room, no. 1107, was large and comfortable, with a double bed and a sofa. As a guest one has free access to the Observation Deck, the SkyPark and infinity pool. The hotel also has several restaurants to choose from.",Date of stay:
Quality has gone downhill,"I have stayed there a few times. It used to be a really good hotel, but recently quality has gone down a lot. Prices are up from like 400 to 1200 per night and the SGD is stronger so value is obv worse. But many other things have deteriorated with the hotel.

Checkin is slow, long lines, moving slowly, taking long time for each customer. Early checkin not available and no notice when the room was ready. New Premium rooms are filled with alcohol mixers and fancy heavy stone pieces leaving little space left, no desk so no workspace, if you want to use a laptop you have to do it on the floor. There is construction going on making my room vibrate and be noisy from 11 to 6pm. Pool is crowded, often you cannot find a single sunbed available. The gym has moved into the shopping centre which is awkward. The lift at Tower 2 doesn't work so lots of people end up going up and down to get to Spago. When you leave the aircon automatically goes to max so you come back to an icy cold room every time and TV is on every time. Room service didn't do any turndown while I was out until 8pm with ""please make up room"" on for 3h.

If you stay here you do it because it's a unique hotel, but don't expect to leave as a happy guest.

Some good things though. Bed is comfy, cool AC knob, tea and chocolate are great and yeah it's an epic building for sure!",Date of stay:
Treated like Farm Animals,"Raymond Tan, Guardian of the Toilets on the 56th floor and very rude. I was carrying a fussy baby and trying to calm him along the row of paintings outside the restrooms. Raymond literally screamed at us and engaged aggressively as we approached the end of the hallway. Accused me and the baby of trespassing like common criminals.
He then condescendingly ushered us away like pigs and sheep.
Such a shame that the icon of Singapore has such poor hospitality. I understand the need to prevent non hotel guests from entering certain areas but staff are trained less in courtesy and more in damage control.

Immaculate experience at Marina Bay Sands,"Stayed at MBS over the week and it was beyond words. The pool view and the room view was incredible and we can’t wait to be back again at the hotel. Check in was quite long and the staff at check in was very impatient, so we were quite disappointed. The staff, who was a young Chinese lady wearing glasses simply rushed the process and made it seem like they can’t wait for us to leave the desk! We queued for over 10 minutes and we get this treatment at check-in which was unbelievable. But truthfully, besides that particular staff, every other employee was extremely friendly and me and my wife enjoyed the stay so much that we have already booked for another one! Special thanks to Elena from the concierge who was extremely helpful. We followed her recommendation to places which was great and she was so kind in assisting us with taxi. Would like to thank another staff but unfortunately we forgot his name, he kindly assisted us with our luggage and very gently guided us to the queue when we first arrived. We hope to encounter them when we return next month. Truly hope to receive a better check in experience when we return next month.",Date of stay:

Good Experience,"The Hotel itself it’s Amazing

We Arrived at 3 for Check in and we have to queue for a long time to get our room cause it was so busy.

there are 4 of us and we booked 2 rooms. we stayed at tower 3 of marina bay sands. The front desk specially Jewel she’s very kind and the concierge staff were very friendly and helpful.

Our room is spacious, and clean. Loved the balcony it had amazing view.

The Infinity pool had great view, too bad that when we went to Singapore the weather was gloomy so we missed the sunset view.

The hotel itself was very big, and they directly connected to the shoppes (big mall where everything exists, including casino)",Date of stay:
This was our 3rd stay at MBS and was very delightful in everyway!

Exquisite experience in Singapore,"I am madly in love with the place. It was our first family trip to Singapore. Everything is unbelievable, every step feels like an adventure and our kids were in awe. 6 days in Singapore is too short and we should have stayed longer most specially in Marina Bay Sands. It was our dream to go up on top of that building and we finally made it. I would like to thank the check in staff who gave us a complimentary upgrade to the newly renovated room as it looks so upscale though i was not sure how does the non renovated room looks like. I remember her name is RJ, she was very pleasant and efficient. The waiting time in line was very long and tiring but it was all worth it upon our turn to checked in. She welcomed us with a very warm smile and enthusiasm and everything has switched into a positive vibe. The lollipops for the kids is a plus and the kids books too which makes the kids at ease while waiting for our turn. I didn’t expected to get our room ready as the check in time is 3pm but RJ was too fast and efficient and made sure that we can get a room as she knew that we were travelling with kids. It was a plus for the upgrade and we really wished that we can stay longer. The pool is amazing and the view of the gardens. We have tried the buffet and everyone enjoyed it so much, they have too many options for the buffet. The hotel is too crowded and people are everywhere. It was a good vibe though not the usual hotel that you can imagine. We will definitely come back. Thank you for the great experience.",Date of stay:
Premium holiday!,"Husband and myself stayed for 1 week to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary.

The moment we stepped out of SVU from the airport we were welcomed by Yasmina who made check in and our check out easy! Not having to line up at the counter after a long flight.

Premium service gave that extra personal touch. If we needed anything or need bookings Yasmina was able to assist. Even decorated our room since it was our anniversary.

The room was magnificent as it was newly renovated and the view was what you paid for.

Staff were always professional but friendly. I recommend Sands premium booking at Marina Bay Sands as you won’t be disappointed!

Marina Bay & Joanne- Exquisite above the rest!,"Thank you Marina Bay Sands for giving my family THE BEST vacation! The place is spectacular, everyone is so hospitable and the feel of the hotel is amazing with so much to do, a plethora of food options to indulge in, shopping and the one of a kind rooftop infinity pool! The immense amenities will blow any other hotel away! I must give my highest praise and thank you to Joanne-assistant mgr of premium services. She provided the most amazing hospitality like no other hotel we stayed before! We stayed 4 days in Marina bay then decided to stay in the city but was highly disappointed. We called Marina bay and although they were fully booked, Joanne worked hard to help find rooms for my family and even offered to pick us up to transport us back over so that we can end our vacation right! She really went above and beyond for my family of 7! This is the epitome of customer service! MBS...she is a GEM!! I will be forever thankful to Joanne for the top notch hospitality, ensuring every detail of our vacation was so wonderful and making sure my kids, parents and family had the best time! She won our hearts and our love for this hotel! This is the only place to stay in Singapore...everywhere else is incomparable! If you want a memorable vacation...Marina Bay is it!! Joanne you are THE BEST and really exemplify the exquisite premium service that puts Marina bay sands above the rest! We will never forget you and your team.

A Unique Hotel Which Needs Further Improvement,"We had booked a Delux Twin Room with a rollaway bed for our teen. We waited for about 45 mins to get checked in. The front desk attendant told me they are going to upgrade us to a Delux Suite on high floors which was a pleasant surprise. At first she said the suite was smoking and when I said No Way she gave us a beautiful suite on 36 floor of tower one with 2 queens beds. The suite is beautiful and fully updated with high
end decor, furniture and amenities but with only ONE BIG PROBLEM! There is constant drilling, hammering and construction noise from morning to night and last night it extended to 9PM! We were never told about the low floors of the Delux rooms which we found out latter to be floor 2-11. Additionally we were not told about the construction noise when I accepted the upgrade. The reason for 3 stars is that MBS must fully disclose on its website and partners websites such as Expedia the floor where the room is located and the description of the view as well issues such as construction noise. While the staff are courteous, and responsive and the hotel is great in terms of its architecture, guest experience needs significant improvement in the above areas.",Date of stay:

Amazing Experience!,"Best customer service and care that a guest could possibly think of, i am a traveller and can claim that this is by far the best experience my family & I had! Although the check in was an extremely long wait, but the staff made up for it. From the first welcome as we were checked in by a lovely lady named Rose, she was so warm and accommodating to our needs and even managed to give us an upgrade! We wanted to thank her again on our check out day but did not manage to find her. As it’s our first time here in Singapore, we approached the concierge and was also extremely well taken care of by a young lady named Elena, who was extremely bubbly and patient with the buzzing questions we had. What a lovely coincidence that she and our youngest bears the same name, and we were even more surprised to find out she was only 20 years old! All in all from the start till the lovely token leaving the hotel, all employees were helpful and cheerful which was very comforting and welcoming, and we truly enjoyed our 3 day stay here. My family and i would like to truly thank Rose and Elena for making our stay livelier, and we hope to be served by them with their top tier service the next time we’re back. Best customer service if that’s what you look for in a hotel.",Date of stay:

Terrible experience,"We normally stay at the Four Seasons when in Singapore and it was a big mistake staying here on our visit this time. Outdated rooms no where near a five star standard. The beds were so hard and felt like sleeping on wood. Bath towels were small and felt like sandpaper. When we provided our feedback to the hotel their response was that rooms in our tower 3 had not been renovated unlike rooms in tower 1 and 2 so they offered us a token $100 credit.
Check in took 40 minutes to find interconnecting rooms for our young children. Incredibly they first suggested we take rooms on the opposite sides of the floor.
20 minute wait for seating at breakfast. I could go on. Lesson learnt, will not be staying here again.",Date of stay:
Wonderful spa experience,"Excellent service and wonderful massage, scrub and wrap. And the location is amazing on the 55th floor of marina bay sands.

Excellent Service and Experience,"Had a 1 night stay between connections, arrived around 10am, checked in, our baggage was put into storage and we were given a temporary card to use facilities before our room was available, which wasn't till 3pm.. This allowed us to go onto the sky deck and use the infinity pool. Next day we checked out at 11. Was again given temporary cards to use for the day until 8pm!

Memorable experience.,"A birthday’s treat to stay two nights in this iconic hotel. All the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, especially Grace who arranged a few special treats for my birthday, I was very grateful.
Fabulous view from floor 35 of the gardens and all the ships at anchor. We were glad that we walked into the gardens on the first night to see the light show as it was better from underneath, and it rained the following night.
My only niggle is that the children have a large area of pool, in fact the whole of the infinity pool I believe, and there is only one small area of sun chairs and jacuzzi’s designated adult only. This was not watched over by staff so we frequently had young kids in the jacuzzi and running around and screaming which spoilt the experience.",Date of stay:

And THE VIEW through floor to ceiling windows was absolutely spectacular! The service we experienced was stellar. As it was my birthday, they guided us to the lounge area to get checked in, and had a staff (Joanne if I'm not wrong) escort us to our room. She was great, and even helped us to book a sunset pool slot even though they were supposedly ""fully booked"" on the booking website. Champagne & cake were delivered to the room too. All other staff we met were super friendly and helpful as well. Thank you MBS for the wonderful stay!",Date of stay:
MBS most memorable stay,"We stayed 5 nights in a harbour view room on level 42.
Checkin was quick and we were made to feel welcome.
Room was spacious and the views spectacular. Bed and pillows are a little on the hard side.
Obviously we stayed here to experience the infinity pool and it didn’t disappoint. Pool and bar staff are amazing. Special shout out to Maurice, Mary & Ryan.
Location is also close to so many attractions and food options.
Only small criticism we have is the breakfast in Spago. The manger should take a trip to W @ Sentosa to see how a breakfast should be done.
Having said that it didn’t affect our stay and we loved every minute of our time here and will be back for sure. Everyone at the hotel went above and beyond to make sure our stay was memorable and it made for one of the best holidays we have ever had.",Date of stay:

MBS with Kids for a perfect weekend…happy Father’s Day,"This is my first visit to the most infamous hotel in Singapore

Upon arrival surprised by the sheer crowns of guest at lobby, at lobby , lines were extreme long, water and lolly pops where served at lines and I was checking in with wife and 2 kids

Lobby manager pull us from the line and ask us to the star lounge i notice mainly for guest who are seniors or with kids

Was served very quickly by Jennifer Yeoh at the star lounge, the service was very quick and very very attention. It was the small gestures of simple “MR chew I guess the kids maybe tired from the trip, allow me to quickly get a room from your family to settle down and take a shower”… this I would say are simple hospitality thoughts which go a long long way from our experience.m

The location of MBS was great, integrated SMRT, Mall, Food, the Park… for morning walks and etc

The room view… excellent…baby cot was ready, only surprise no bathtub

The famous pool at 57th floor was more a dipping pool than a swimming pool but nevertheless my family had a splash 🤭💪. Service again was excellent from Ryan and team… greetings are by name and service was swift

Overall experience of the hotel, excellent, will definitely return",Date of stay:

Second time staying - wont ever stay again.,"This was my second time staying at Marina Bay Sands. The first time I came home raving about it. I now would not recommend it to my worst enemy.
The building is of course impressive, especially from the outside. But at more than AUD $1000/night for a basic room, the interior standards need to be much higher.
I have given 2 stars for each of the limo drivers we encountered. They were fantastic and so helpful. I would also like to note that I did contact Marina Bay twice over the past 2 weeks to discuss our experience with them before posting this review but they did not bother to respond.
The room was, on first glance, neat and tidy. Underwhelming but ok I guess. You can see photos on the website for what it resembles (loosely however, you need to take new photos). However, once you look closely you could see how filthy it was. I took a few photos as examples.
There was mould growing in the bathroom (see photo 1). There were brown spray like marks up the walls near the toilet, which you are left to imagine what they are (photo 2). The ceiling in the bedroom never airs out so is permanently damp (see photo 3) and upon opening a drawer to try and find some champagne glasses (the drawer hadnt even been stocked with glasses) there was a sticky mess (see photo 4).
The view from the pool is always impressive however on this stay, it looked dated and dirty. The lounges were faded and sun damaged and the 'wow-factor' of the place has worn off.
The ceiling dampness was a concern. We tried to air it out be letting in some fresh air but as soon as you open the door to the balcony the air conditioner shuts off and the room gets very warm. We were travelling with a baby (which makes the condition and cleanliness of this place even worse) and had to keep her cool so couldnt keep trying to fix their air quality problem.
It looks to me as if maintenance has gone out the door. I have stayed in 3 star hotels in Vietnam for $60/night that were nicer and better maintained than this.
Location is great for convenience as there is a shopping centre underneath with all the overpriced designers in it. No where to sit in there though unless you are dining so be wary if you have people with you who are elderly, disabled or carrying small children. There is no place to rest for 2 minutes.
All up, very disappointing. We are not made of money. This was a treat for our honeymoon/husbands birthday and I felt let down. Especially after having a great stay previously. I would usually advise to stay a night or two just for the pool but wouldnt bother with that now.
I love Singapore and look forward to returning again however I will not be bothering with Marina bay. It is a tourist trap.",Date of stay:

Best service experience!!,"Me and husband were celebrating our honeymoon and on our way home from Bali we stopped in Singapore. I had been to Singapore before and dreamed to stay at the sands one day. This time I was able to afford to stay and was not disappointed. When we arrived at check-in we had a little issue with the site we had booked the stay through but the front desk was so accommodating working with us, they really made us feel welcomed and valued. After we got to the room which had amazing views. At night you could watch the light show from your room. We booked a time to go to the pool. And the pool was beyond beautiful!! We ordered food and with all the people there I was amazed how fast and attentive the staff was to our needs. Later that night we ended up ordering room service because the restaurant didn’t have any openings but the menu and food was amazing. The menu had so many different kinds of foods! It was the best room service I had ever had!
In the morning we then did the breakfast buffet up top where the pool is located. Amazing food again and service. Me and husband love to travel and usually don’t book more expensive hotels but I definitely thought it was worth the money and will for sure be back. The service was immaculate, even though there were tons of guests I felt there was always a staff member there providing one on one attention.",Date of stay:
2nd time around,"My second stay here and only writing another review this time around to call out two things for my fellow travelers.

1. If you check-in early, they can store your bags and will offer to call/text/email you when your room is ready. I didn't receive any of those come check-in time so I went to the front desk to inquire. Turns out my room was in fact, ready. So, if they forget, just poke them, or you risk waiting well into the evening.

2. One big reason for staying at this hotel is access to that amazing ""selfie"" infinity pool. FYI every single guest that enters the pool area needs a room key. We did not find this out till after taking 3 separate elevators from our room to get to the pool. Sooo back down we went to fetch that other card. Apparently this stipulation is printed in tiny font on the back of your room key card (because everyone always examines their room key in microscopic detail). Front desk person should've mentioned but neglected to so I'm letting y'all know now so you don't have to do the extra trek. Make sure each person in your party gets a key at check-in and brings it with them to the pool (not sure what to do about children...).

Other than that, a pleasant stay. Premier rooms are really nice, visiting the gardens is very convenient and tons of really great food/shopping options without ever losing air-con. Remember it's a massive hotel (Vegas-style) so they deal with everything in scale. You get pros and cons with that. Crazy lines at check-in/out and maybe the neglected ""room ready"" alert, but also bellhops who move fast and a continuously line of taxis for you catch (versus the 10 minute wait at other quieter hotels).",Date of stay:
Perfect stay at the best hotel in the world,"Booked the room with the garden view for 1 night and honestly it’s the best hotel we’ve ever stayed in. From check in, to all the members of staff, the food, the free mini bar in the room, the view and the swimming pool on the top floor, everything was perfect. It was also my partners birthdays and my requests for arranging a cake to be brought to the room was carried out with no problems whatsoever and at no extra charge. The beds are comfortable, everything was spotless, and we couldn’t have asked for a better stay. Value for money is absolutely justified as every detail is perfect down to the last centimetre.",Date of stay:

Stayed in a Deluxe King Sky View room on level 43 with fantastic views of the city. Room is spacious, comfortable and clean. Two enormous TVs in the room were great for the short time we were winding down in the room.
The pool on the roof is everything you expect. Incredible views and experience. Also generally a great spot to relax and unwind.

Must stay if you visit Singapore,"When the lady at front desk found out I left Singapore 25 years ago as an ESPN sports anchor and lecturer at NUS, now returned as a professor to give a seminar presentation, she worked with a manager very hard to upgrade our two rooms to one beautiful two-bedroom suite on the 43rd floor facing the bay. Our family really enjoyed the stay at Marina Bay Sands that is second to none. Your hospitality made our stay in Singapore the highlight of our entire trip in Southeast Asia. We will definitely come back.",Date of stay:
Disappointing sanitary standards,"The hotel did not live up to its expectations. The rooms were OK, and everything was fine until ants started showing up in our room. Started off with one single ant in the morning, and at night the same day we had a trail of ants below a pillow on the bed. Totally unacceptable. We also noticed that sheets were tidied up but not changed for a couple days. Slow front desk.

You’ll be left tired and hungry,"Terrible service….

The MBS is an incredible place there is no two ways about it…however my wife and I arrived at the hotel at around 9am after 13hr flight. We were told that our rooms were not ready and we had to wait for a text message letting us know that they were ready. After several hours of waiting they still weren’t ready and told me I had to continue to wait. And it was possible that they weren’t going to be ready until 3pm.
We tried to get some food by the pool however was turned away (even though it was open and other people were sitting in there). I stated to the staff at the front desk that we were extremely jet lagged and we were turned away at one of the restaurants. I find this incredibly hard to believe that an establishment like the MBS don’t allow check in before 3pm even though there are multiple long haul flights landing early in the morning. The staff weren’t prepared to offer any type of compensation either so we and the wife just sat in the lobby and waited. Bored tired and hungry.

I wouldn’t not recommend it here.",Date of stay:

"Wonderful Luxurious Hotel, From Deluxe to Luxe","We had multiple stays at Marina Bay Sands over the course of two weeks because we simply enjoyed the hospitality and facilities of the hotel. We actually decided to stay in different types of rooms so we could get the full MBS experience.

We started with the standard Deluxe Room which was great. The was cozy, the bed was comfy and the view of the Gardens by the Bay was amazing.

Next, we decided to stay in one of the new Sands Premier Rooms which is part of their new Luxe collection. Immediately, we could already tell the room is more spacious and luxurious. We loved the pantry as well as the lovely bathroom.

Finally, we stayed at the Sands Premier Suite. This was definitely our favourite room. We felt that this suite was much better than the traditional suites in MBS because the furniture and fixtures are modern, luxurious and comfortable. Just like the Sands Premier Room, we thoroughly enjoyed the pantry, the view and the bathroom!

We will definitely be coming back to MBS very soon for another stay since MBS has a very special place in our hearts (we got engaged there!). But more than that, the services, the staff and the facilities make all the difference in making our stays wonderful and memorable.

Thank you so much and see you again soon!",Date of stay:

The room was beautiful, super clean, the bathroom stylish, with great showerhead and a soap holder in the shower. Comfy bed, good pillows, automated curtains, discreet aircon, quiet. The view was to die for - I chose the ""garden view"" and I still shik it's the (slightly) better option since the city view is available from the pool, the Gardens by the bay is a more unique landmark that the bunch of skyscrapers, plus this room comes with a balcony. The pool and the 3 hotel towers are absolutely iconic, one of the most famous landmarks of Singapore. This is not just a high-end hotel but one of the most famous hotels in the entire world, one that deserves a stay from everybody. A flawless experience.
It is really hard to find anything to criticize. Maybe the breakfast was only a 9/10, since it could use some more variety, and one item from the buffet was out of stock by the time we arrived. (Information about breakfast items: eggs, sausages, bacon, potatoes, curries, oriental noodle soups, fresh fruit, sweet pastries, cheese, yoghurt, salad in the buffet; can order more elaborate egg dishes, additional oriental noodles, dim sum from an a la carte menu.)",Date of stay:
Another great stay at the iconic MBS,"This was our second short stay at MBS and in many ways it has improved over the last few years. Check-in was very busy so we checked in early for the two rooms we had booked thanks to Jemeh and Han's excellent customer service, we were grateful to get one of the rooms 90 minutes early, this enabled us to head up and store our bags while we went down to the huge and extensive food court. When we opened the door we soon realised we had been upgraded to the beautiful Sands Premiere room that had been recently refurbished and was still very crisp and fresh. The attention to detail was mind blowing, lovely coffee cups, glasses etc, even the coffee machine was clad in tan leather!. The level of toiletries was excellent, all fine quality, no skimping here. The room size was large and we had a lovley view over the Gardens by the bay. The huge Super King size bed was so comfortable with huge soft pillows. Got to love those Japanese Toto loos, the lid opened and mood (bowl) lighting came on as you entered the separate room. We stayed in tower one so had immediate access to the pool on level 57 by lighting fast lifts. It must have been a quiet time as the pool wasn't busy at all and was lovely soaking and gazing down at the CBD. Check out was fairly prompt at the hands of KC who was super friendly and efficient. I recommend to all our friends to treat themselves at MBS if they're able when traveling to Singapore, yes you are just a number in a huge almost impersonal hotel, but in terms of wow factor, she never fails to impress.",Date of stay:
Sadly underwhelmed,It is without doubt a stunning hotel but with such high expectations it fell short. We upgraded to the high life and sands club for additional benefits. One was VIP check in as that area was busy we went to the main check in. After a day long journey a cold drink and a more personal welcome would have been good. First room for 3 adults king-size bed and a camped taped up with black masking tape. Complained second room 2 king-size but lost the balcony. Breakfasts club 55 the best Spago the worst but nothing special. Infinity pool please have an adults only area none of the kids use the kids pool so was like a kids water park. Afternoon tea and drinks with canapies great idea but should be enjoyed in all areas not just Renku Lobby bar and so disappointing that there were never hot vegetarian options. More personal service is needed. It caters more for tourists than hotel guests sorry,Date of stay:

Wonderful pool view everything, I want also specially mention Moe what a amazing person and lifeguard had great time and conversation with him.",Date of stay:
Incredible hotel,"When planning our honeymoon we knew we HAD to stay here! Me and my husband have wanted to stay at this hotel for such a long time and it really did not disappoint!

The staff were amazing! The room was amazing, the view from the room and the roof was amazing! The pool was incredible!

We feel extremely lucky and fortunate to have stayed here on our once in a lifetime trip!

We wish we could come back and would do anything to come back here again! If you get the chance, stay here, you will not be disappointed.",Date of stay:
Memorable Experience,Been here for the first time with my Family and Friends..And i must say that everything is perfect❤️..Only that when we about to go swimming we cant enter coz it's look like going to rain and there's a sign of lightning after everything is fine they let us in and thats it my kids enjoyed the pool to the point that they dun want to go back to our room😀..Highly Recommended!!,Date of stay:
Large conference hotel,"I stayed at Marina Bay in 2018 and was excited to come back. Like last time, I requested a room overlooking Gardens by the Bay on a higher floor. I was somewhat disappointed that I could not stay for the full length of my trip, so I stayed at JW Marriott for the first part.

I liked Marina Bay (MBS) but found that the hotel was extremely large, chaotic and although the views were still stunning, my experience at JW was better. Beds/linens/pillows were more comfortable (beds are extremely hard at MBS).

I also found the room decor teetering on tired.",Date of stay:
Spectacular hotel convenient to downtown Singapore,We had a wonderful time at this amazing property. The location is perfect and within walking distance to many popular attractions in Singapore. In addition the rooftop pool is spectacular! I will gladly stay here again.,Date of stay:
Ever memorable moment,"WOW….on 20 May 2023 will be an ever-memorable in my life. We celebrated my 50th birthday and our wedding anniversary in MBS hotel. I booked two deluxe rooms for my family. On the day of checking, they are given an unexpected gift are presidential suit at level 50 instead. It was a wonderful experience for us. We enjoyed it a lot. Thanks to MBS staff for their hospitality and wonderful services. Once again thanks MBS for your outstanding gratitude and make colourful our event.",Date of stay:
Wonderfully stay,"Staying at the Sands Hotel is a wonderful thing, convenient for transportation and full of facilities. I bought a lot of gifts in giftshop, and the staff Jessie politely introduced a lot of them. I went to the pool on the 57th floor to watch the scenery, went to Cut, and received the warm service from coral. Gardens by the Bay and apple store are also very beautiful, and love them very much. Definitely come again next time",Date of stay:
Stellar Personalized Service,"The stellar service began when a MBS staffer met us at our arrival gate and walked us through customs, baggage claim and our awaiting MBS limousine. Upon arrival, Andre Choo from the Premium Services team met us at the door and escorted us to our room where he and his colleague did our check in. No waiting in line! Throughout our stay, the Premium Services team surprised us with gifts like Singapore Sling makings for each of us complete with individual shakers. So fun! Too many other special touches by the Premium Services team. They made our anniversary trip with our family incredibly memorable.",Date of stay:
One for Instagram,"We stayed here for two nights on our way back to a trip to Sydney. It is a lovely hotel. Pretty massive, reminding us a bit of Vegas (no real surprise given the owners).
Check in was pretty smooth, although it took us some time as the assistant was trying to get us a room higher up, which she succeeded in doing.
Our room (2910) in Tower 3 had a great view over Gardens by the Bay, so we watched the light show from our balcony one evening. You could also see the final corners of the F1 circuit if you leant out a bit.
The room itself was lovely, large and very clean. Easy controls for the lights and curtains. The biggest TV we have ever seen in a hotel room, although there were not too many western channels. They seemed to be automated to reduce air con usage when we left the room.
The bathroom was nice too, with great toiletries. No bath, just a nice shower.
The beds were pretty hard, but we slept OK so didn't mention it.
There is free water, soft drinks and snacks plus an espresso machine in the room.
There are two sets of lifts per tower. They service up to floor 34 and floor 34 and above. If you want to go to the rooftop, you can go up from say 29 to 34 and then change lifts for the remainder of the journey.
The hotel and adjoining shopping centre have an unbelievable range of options for food. Breakfast was included in our package, and I would recommend you avoid Spago unless you really need to eat on the rooftop and go to Rise on the ground floor instead. The choice at the buffet is phenomenal. We even had dinner there one day.
If you don't want to visit the pool, you are probably in the wrong hotel. Apart from being an engineering marvel, it is so amazing to be in an infinity pool 57 floors up. The area is divided in two with the pool facing the city and some other loungers in the gardens on the side facing the Singapore Strait. This is handy as the sun rises on one side and sets on the other, so you can move around to find some shade if you want to.
Hotel guests also get free access to the Observation Deck.
The hotel is also excellent value for money, given the cost to construct it.",Date of stay:
Three nights at the Marina Bay complex,"A destination hotel and most certainly a place where many of its clientele want to be seen. It is an extremely large hotel with a shopping mall, gardens, museums and casino attached.
The staff are helpful, but because of its size the hotel is rather impersonal. However, the views from the higher floors and the rooftop pool, bars and restaurants are impressive. Lots of restaurants and bars, but not if you want a simple quiet beer.",Date of stay:
MBS Premium Services Team,"I am feeling very happy to stay in MBS Hotel, everything are convenience and very impressive with MBS Premium Services Team by Mac & Yasmina, they are both super nice, friendly and excellent management in everything, Highly recommend !!",Date of stay:
The wonders of MBS!,"I've been a regular at MBS for a number of years now and I've truly enjoyed it every time I stayed there. I may not be a celebrity or a VIP but the services I experienced and the food i ate have been nothing short of amazing! For tourists, this is the only hotel to stay if you're visiting for a holistic Singapore experience. For locals, a must try if its not already on your bucket list!",Date of stay:
Thank You Premium!!,"Best staff ever Andre from Premium Team. We have 4 rooms and very messy the booking but Andre helped us a lot and I was relieved I meet him!!
From the start keep telling me everything will be good because it is a vacation and in the end everything is good because of him
Super caring gentle funny and helpful and always saying he will be there to help if we need. He make my heart slow down and able to relax

a perfect experience,"The attitude of the service staff is very good and they are very patient. My wife and I proposed here. It was a very perfect experience and we will definitely stay here again!
During the three months from the start of the preparation to the present, the service personnel have been very attentive in assisting in arranging the proposal, and continued to communicate with us and provide equipment.",Date of stay:
Super impressed,"I was so impressed with this resort. Having visited ce la vi and spago in the past as a tourist I thought the hotel would be overcrowded however the stay felt extremely exclusive you have a separate elevator to access your room and also access to the famous infinity pool. The breakfast was also excellent. The staff also went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant stay. This hotel is centrally located and you have access to the mall, Marina and gardens by the bay. I would definitely stay here again.",Date of stay:
Best staycation experience!,"The interior design elements of the newly-refurbished room are immaculate. I loved every single detail: from fixtures to furnishing; from amenities to accent pieces - the room has to be lived in to be believed.

I had a lovely staycation there thanks to the very able and affable members of the Premier Services team. They were thoughtful and responsive - often going out of their way to offer assistance. Beyond the Premier Services team, every hotel staff we liaised with projected professionalism and patience despite the fast-paced work environment. The consistency in service delivery throughout my 4-day stay truly deserves a shout-out.",Date of stay:
A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE,"Our experience was a continual WOW factor from go to whoa. Made to feel exceptionally special at every venue we visited. Staff amazng and there to please each and every guest. The highlight (hard to pick just one) had to be the infinity pool and the view. A must do!!! Thank you everyone who gave my stepdaughter, (celebrating her 50th birthday) and myself an amazing, memorable stay. An experience that will be very hard to beat. View from room, Gardens by the Bay, with balcony, outstanding.",Date of stay:
A well rested stay,"Whenever I am tired I would check into this hotel to have my rest and once again it has been really good.
This batch of rooms are the newly upgraded ones called Sands Premier rooms. Very clean and neat with modern amenities within the room. The bathroom is spacious with double sinks, bathtub, separate shower area and toilet.
You can opt for really comfortable king size bed or double queen size beds depending on availability. Four fluffy pillows are provided so you can stack anyway you want.
Overall, the service provided by this hotel is excellent, as always!",Date of stay:
Best experience ever,"This is my favorite hotel in Singapore. The service is commendable. I really enjoy my stay here, the facilities are the best also especially the pool and the bath tub in the room. The view is so perfect also. But what I love the most are the very accommodating, warm staff especially Mr. Andre Choo. He knows best how to handle clients and very good in addressing our concerns.",Date of stay:
Perfect experience,"Wonderful stay. Special thanks to Mark, who welcomed us and took care of all our questions/ requests. The hotel is impressive! The only suggestion for improvement relates to the treatment prior to arrival (booking the transfer from the ferry terminal to the hotel was a bit cumbersome and it would have been nice if the hotel reached out proactively a few days ahead to offer the transfer).",Date of stay:
A must for the pool,"Really enjoyed marina bay sands - it’s a must if you travel to Singapore.
Check was a little long winded as mentioned in other reviews and I was told on check in that an extra bed wasn’t available even though I had requested one when I booked and had paid extra for it. I stood my ground & showed them my emails and an extra bed was magically found. This was my only below par experience of my whole trip and everything went smoothly after that.
Pool is amazing and speaks for itself. I was presently surprised it wasn’t particularly busy either, I was always able to get a sun bed next to the pool.
Location of hotel is great especially with its own MRT station. Use the MRT it was so cheap, efficient and we felt very safe",Date of stay:
Great city view to enjoy the best glance of Singapore,"40th floors, great city view and best service.

First and once experience everyone should try, great service with nice day and night view, high tea and buffet breakfast included.

Kids enjoy the stay, only thing is the car park that cost $35/ 24 hours with mutil entry.",Date of stay:
Probably the best hotel in the world,"Great service, particularly from Gary on reception (was able to check in slightly earlier no extra charge) and Roger in the Blossom restaurant. Corner room was very large, huge walk-in shower. Amazing view of gardens. I would say garden view side better view than bay side due to shopping centre. Hotel and surroundings basically make it a resort. The food court below the hotel/shops was amazing. Infinity pool is definitely a modern wonder and a life goal. Loved the Blossom restaurant but probably a bit pricey especially considering the standard of the much cheaper food court stalls. I had takeaway breakfast from the cafe in tower 3. Was great. All in all worth every penny. Probably best hotel i have ever stayed in, definitely the best pool ever. Also - great Gym",Date of stay:
To Infinity and Beyond,"The Infinity pool experience at MBS is worth the price of the room. It is spectacular! Had breakfast at the pool, and our server JAYSEN was the best!

Avoid Unless You Enjoy Crowds & Booked-out Restaurants and Bars.,"Our 5th stay over four days and will never return. Today, way too many people everywhere to the extent was never able to book a restaurant and failed to get a drink on four occasions.

The whole place feels like a shopping center on Christmas Eve with every publicly accessible facility packed and very unpleasant experience trying to navigate.",Date of stay:
Amazing hotel with fabulous swimming pool,"Great hotel, really nice breakfast, great service from arrival and all throughout stay, super clean and amazing swimming pool! The view from the room was just stunning (ask for a room higher up, it is worth the additional cost).",Date of stay:
Birthday Surprise,We went to one of the restaurant for my daughter’s birthday and we had a wonderful experience as the staff did an amazing surprise for my daughter by arranging a beautiful chocolate cake as well as singing the birthday song by almost the entire crew beautifully with mesmerising rhythm as I only informed the manager to get us a best seat since it’s a special occasion to be remembered and my daughter was taken off the ground as she didn’t expected anything like that and we will cherish those moments forever.,Date of stay:
Inconsistent staff and rude guests,"Had a great stay here. Got upgraded to a higher room for my birthday and chocolate cake in room. SkyPark has great views but is ruined by the guests - some are incredibly rude to the staff and it’s just embarrassing/upsetting to be around. We were allowed to use SkyPark for the day after we checked out but the shower facilities are not nice at all and definitely not 5* level.

All staff were lovely and accommodating aside from check out where the process is very rushed and impersonal - feels like because you’ve stayed and they have your money they no longer care about your experience. We found Andrea and Patrick at Tower 3 check out particularly rude (there was a man who i didn't get the name of handing out water to guests who was great).

overall it is worth coming here for the views and rooms but Skypark is subpar for a 5* hotel.",Date of stay:
Best Service in MBS,We have been very delighted with the premium service of MBS. Joanne and John have shown us great hospitality and helped us in making our stay very good. They even helped us for planning the attraction we should while we stay in Singapore and also suggested us with good place to eat. Thank you so much for your service. We would love to visit back soon.,Date of stay:
"When at the MBS, ask for Andre, Silver, and Ramon! For weddings, Rachel, Ken, and Raimondo are THE A-TEAM!","Singapore is a world within our world, but the Marina Bay Sands is a special world apart! We booked our wedding at the Convention Center and enjoyed an extended stay at the hotel. Our only regret was not staying longer to take in all the rich amenities on offer at this amazing property.

To us, MBS is a marvel of soaring architecture that has been distilled into an intuitive, uniquely human, and tactile environment. At every turn, there are thoughtfully-curated vignettes that embrace and delight. When you layer in the courteous professionalism of EVERY team member we encountered, you are left with the impression of being cocooned in a climate of uncompromising and unapologetically-personalized customer service excellence.

Rachel, Ken, Raimondo and their team members created an EPIC wedding venue in the Begonia Room that was part Singapore, part Hollywood, and pure MBS! The meticulous attention to detail during our long distance planning (from Atlanta, Georgia, USofA) and later onsite execution by the build team was matched by the service and wait staff in every meaningful way. Every guest walked away with the impression they had experienced a singularly special event.

Andre and the Premium Services Team contacted us before arrival, arranged transportation, and were waiting to introduce us to the property and our lovely, pristine, and richly appointed room. Each and every venue we encountered, from the Infinity Pool to the Banyan Room and several restaurants in-between were feasts for the senses and echoed the epitome of quality and customer service. Of the way-too-many staff members to name, Silver and Ramon stood out as singular exemplars of the MBS brand.

To everyone at MBS, we salute you for doing both the little and the big things right, for being amongst the very best we have encountered in our decades of travel, and for creating a memory for a lifetime and beyond. f&T :)",Date of stay:
Best room ever stayed in,"The new sands premier suite was top notch, from personal service, limousine pick up/drop off, to amenities - including Dyson hairdryer, wireless charging dock. My kids had a splashing good time in the huge bath tub. The room had smart features. The toilet bowl cover would open by itself when it sense u entering. Wished it would also automatically close the cover first before the auto flush comes on. We would definitely stay again. Amazing views of the city.",Date of stay:

Once in a lifetime splurge on VIP package worth it,"My siblings and I booked a surprise stay at the MBS for my parents as their wedding anniversary gift, and decided to go all out on the High Life Package in the Sands Premier Suite for a special once-in-a-lifetime experience. This review is therefore specifically on the service we received from the Premium Services Team and my parent’s stay in the newly renovated suites (the experience will obviously vary depending on your room type and package).

Firstly, the new suites are beautiful!! We had an eye-level view of the Supertree Grove, and the amenities and layout of the suite really lived up to our expectations of a luxe hotel. But what really elevated our stay (and made the price of the room seem more justifiable) was the service we received. We felt the VIP experience from the moment our MBS limousine transfer driver picked us up from our other (more modest) accommodation, to the warm welcome we received from our Premium Services rep, Joanne Catalan, at the MBS entrance. The Premium Services Team (in particular Joanna) provided exceptional customer service throughout our stay! They showed great professionalism, were always willing to assist with our queries and requests, and truly, truly went above and beyond to make my parent’s anniversary stay at the MBS a very special and memorable occasion for our whole family. We are especially grateful for the personalized anniversary surprises, family photo request, and the complimentary limousine transfer upon our departure (this was not a package inclusion but Joanna and her team went out of their way to meet an unusual request, which we were beyond grateful for). Thank you so much to Joanna and all of the Premium Services Team for everything!! Truly wonderful service that lives up to the MBS brand!!! We hope to come back in the future!!",Date of stay:
I feel like a princess and the MBS staff are my trusty entourage,"My family and I are so well taken care of and spoiled, we had the most reliable team looking out for us just a text away. I definitely used up the text privileges a lott to get help making restaurant reservations and whatnot. (Also got sent a cake for my birthday!)
Thanks to Andre from premium services for being so attentive!",Date of stay:
Services with smiles,"From the start to the finish, John and Andre from the Premium Service team, show an immense courtesy, professionalism and knowledge of Singapore and its wonderful attractions. We were met at the airport by an assistant who took us through passport control who without her knowledge, we would have found it’s difficult to answer all the questions to gain entry to the country. They made one kind gesture sending us a complimentary Singapore Sling. The whole team from Premium Service team should be congratulated for the representation of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.",Date of stay:
Fulfil that once in a lifetime accommodation dream,"What an amazing hotel, in its design and modern grandeur. Staff were superb, the pool a must and having a food court, world class shops, all next door to the MRT makes life so much easier. Yes, it costs a kidney or 3, but for a fab treat - just do it!
The pool is only accessible via the guest pathway, and it is a spectacular look at the city. The view over the Gardens at the Bay is beautiful and a great place to watch the night show from the comfort of the room. Staff are super helpful and willing to go the extra mile for you.",Date of stay:
Above and Beyond,"Stayed 3 days 2 nights at MBS. The infinity pool never fails to amaze. The service was impeccable, service staff were always making their rounds making sure guests feel comfortable.

Would like to make special mention to a service staff at the infinity pool, Sid, who made us the best cocktails. Truly his service never fails to bring a smile to me and my best friend’s face.

The room was big and spacious. I sent one of my dresses for laundry. Before I sent it for laundry, I damaged the slit and didn’t mind the slight tear and I just proceeded to send it for washing. But to my surprise, when I received my clean dress, the slit was sewn back! Would like to make a special mention to Chia Leng, who noticed this little slight tear and took the effort to rectify it. Very grateful and im so thankful.

Also ordered room service in which came on time and had a lovely breakfast at the balcony facing gardens by the bay, which was lovely

All the staff were extremely friendly and attentive. 100% will return to MBS.",Date of stay:
Expensive but good experience,"We stayed here for 3 nights and yes we did queue for check In and room wasn’t ready so we went off to explore. When we had our room it was on floor 31 with a good city view and spacious although stayed in better. It was a pain to go to the rooftop pool as you need to take one lift then change and get another but do get there eventually. Now the infinity pool is the Gem for this hotel as perched on the 57th floor and although busy we always managed to find a sun bed. The views from this area are great. We ate at the pool and it’s quite expensive but then what would you expect at one of the most iconic hotels on the planet. We also had breakfast in Spargo’s every day and this is situated by the pool, it was always very busy and slow service but good choice of food and freshly cooked breakfast if required. The hotel is well situated as joined the the Gardens and a Hrt station which will take you all over the city. Would we stay again. Yes of course",Date of stay:
Family vacation,The hotel is very beautiful and massive. Well that everyone knows. For me the best thing about the hotel was its team members. The staff is very courteous and goes out of the way to help. and its not only one department. From front office to house keeping to F&B to security and concierge.,Date of stay:
Not worth the money,"Don't go to this hotel if your are expecting a five star room or service. At best this is a there star hotel. Let's start with the chaos of checking in. Waiting more than an hour in line to see a check in agent, waited another 20 minutes for her to input guest information only to be told our rooms were no available and it would be another hour wait. Once we finally were allowed to go to our rooms, the disappointment continues. The rooms are outdated. Bathroom fixtures are stuff are hard to turn, toilet was old and mouldy and bathroom walls were not clean. Bed was hard and not comfortable. The hotel charges a lot for a nights stay and it is 100% not worth it with so many amazing hotels in Singapore.",Date of stay:
Very expensive and very busy not recommended,"So wanted to stay here after seeing it on the TV on ‘amazing hotels of the world’ but what a disappointment…
1st off its not a 5 star hotel its a vegas type resort and probably 4 star and certainly not worth £500 a night.
Its an amazing feat of engineering for sure but its so big with 1000s of people everywhere you cannot relax or enjoy any of the facilities as they are all packed all of the time.
We couldn’t get any restaurant reservations as they were full. We tried for Spargo but despite 3 emails, 2 tel calls and asking reception we wern’t even replied to. All restaurants have a waiting line and all a ridiculously over priced, I mean 34 bucks for a burger and 7.5 bucks for a bottle of water is a joke ! The buffet restaurant in the lobby is 120 bucks each, for a buffet !!!
The pool is huge but packed and they shut it all the time because of so called lightening strikes which never actually occurred. You even can’t stay on sun beds everybody is rudely moved away.
The rooms are nice but the beds are rock hard, we couldn’t sleep and had bad backs each morning.
The casino is a nightmare to get into having to show passports and entry visas and the same to get out !! There were no ATMs inside the casino so they wanted us to go outside and then queue again and re show documents to get back in !! What a joke…
The huge shopping centre is packed and all the shops are mainly geared towards high rolling Japanese clients who even queue to get into the like of Chanel !
The whole place is just there to rip as much money out of you as possible and send you on your way….
There are much better hotel options in Singapore I would suggest",Date of stay:
mixed,"wanted to stay here having visited singapore a few years ago . had booked the roof restaurant well in advance as it gets busy. This was the one disappointment. Food just ok , service fine but for the price , which is expensive by any comparison - the italian restaurant was more akin to a cross between bella italia and an american diner - would not bother again- hotel service and room were absolutely fine - it is a mad busy very large hotel .Breakfast service on the roof was good if very very busy.",Date of stay:
Awesome experience!,"Very friendly and accomodating staff, from check-in till check out it was all smooth and fast.
Had a room with a great view, and they even sent something in the room upon knowing we are celebrating a special occasion, very thoughtful indeed.
Arts Science Future World was a good place for kids to enjoy.
Kids had a great time in the infinity pool, staff are all friendly, approachable and attentive to all our needs. Dennis was very helpful, he assisted us made sure we have a safe and fun experience since we have kids with us.

"A good stay, not a great stay","The hotel is undoubtedly wow in style, architecture and size. The observation deck and pool are amazing. Our room was huge, well appointed and had a great view of the city. The water, juice etc. are replenished daily. We didn't eat in any of the hotel's restaurants. Our only criticism is the bed was extremely firm and we had 3 uncomfortable night's sleep and sore backs/necks in the morning. Our overall impression - we preferred The Clan in Chinatown, where we stayed our first 4 nights, for its ambience, style and location.",Date of stay:
Infinity pool with a view.,"The infinity pool on the roof was amazing! Breathtaking views during the day and especially at night. Great poolside service with excellent drinks and food.
The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They noticed it was my husband’s birthday during check-in and had cake delivered to our room. The rooms were very nice and comfortable.",Date of stay:
Lovely place to go whatever you plan to do!,"Whether it’s to soak up the Marina Bay cityscapes and the waterfront, shop the most expensive branded items Singapore has to offer, to visit art and science museum with young children, eat all the delicacies (at a marked up price) at Rasapura masters in B2 level Marina Bay Sands or to go up to the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel Skydeck for a stunning 360 view of Singapore, this is a must do.

I took the Taxi from airport (SGD 24) with my family to Marina Bay Sands, but you may chose to do the MRT. Food at the food court was fabulous. Don’t forget to try Chendol (a desert).

Wet to Art and Science Museum to see the Audi Exhibition. Others we did not fancy.
Shopped and walked the waterfront.

Then back to airport. Best way to spend a 10 hour transit.",Date of stay:
Great service and staffs! Room condition could be better,"The overall service was excellent!
We were able to get an early check in, which was more than we could ask for. As for room condition, the room that was assigned to us was in Tower 3, and wasn't in the best shape. I understand that the Tower 2 is under renovation or is renovated already. Hope that for our next visit we could also get a room that's gone under reservation. All the staffs were friendly, location was great. My parents loved the swimming pool. Thank you for the great experience and our check in staff Emilia for getting us into our room early :)

Bucket List,"The MBS was on our bucket list, so we took the plunge. Yeah the hotel is expensive but for us it was a once in a lifetime trip. Could have stayed at the fours seasons for less but it doesn't have a 57th flr infinity pool and the cool light show.

Booked a garden room view and we really enjoyed. Nice balcony and a great view of the skypark, and as a bonus a great view of the light show in the park. The room was nice with a huge TV led (70""). Bed was comfy and a practical layout, but nothing special. Minibar (non-alcoholic) was also included in our rate and was refreshed daily. Also, bottled water was provided daily - we got at least 6 bottles a day, and you could ask for more if needed.

Infinity pool was amazing, with a breathtaking view of the city during and day and night. Pool staff were super friendly and it was great that only hotel guests could use the pool. Having said that, the pool can get super busy so we decided to visit the pool first thing in the morning and end of the evening 9pm and it wasn't busy at all. Very nice !

We used the gym on the 55th floor - amazing views of the city. Lots of modern equipment and the use of a sauna, steamroll, and hot pool in the change room area.

We didn't dine at MBS, but instead wanted to try the Singapore street food, so a quick taxi to chinatown (Maxwell or Lau Pau Sat) with a huge selection of food. The mall in the foodcourt is very good too, if you want to eat in air conditioned comfort :). For us, the MBS was a super convenient location to explore Singapore.

If it's on your bucket list, just do it. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at MBS.

Bonus: We were celebrating our anniversary and one evening, they provided us with a small box of chocolates and some delicious dessert.",Date of stay:
Not Worth It,"The only reason we spent $500 for a night was to go in the famous infinity pool. It was not worth it. The hotel has thousands of people in it, feels like you are in Los Vegas in one of the big gambling casinos. There is a food court that again, thousands of people, not just guests, go to eat. If I had not stayed here, I would have always wondered what it was like at the infinity pool. The room was average with a view of the gardens.",Date of stay:
Awesome,Wonderful hotel with amazing infinity pool friendly staff and great food. Breakfast buffet was perfect and multiple dining options available. View from our rooms on 35 floor was spectacular. Definitely reccommend both for business and with family.,Date of stay:
Overall a good experience,"This review is for Gelo from Spago. His service is fantastic. Always eager to help with great energy. Thank you, man!

The hotel is good. This was our second time here. There is a lot of scope for the staff in general to grow unless the management thinks the scyscraper can make up for it.",Date of stay:
Obnoxious,The architecture is astonishing however the obnoxious staff on more than one occasion make it an awful experience and very shocking. It appears that as the building is so iconic they feel they don't need to provide service. Hop over to Bali to understand and train in excellent customer service,Date of stay:
Not a bad hotel but not worth the price,"Honestly, I was kind of disappointed. The room was smaller than I expected, interior design feels like Hilton (and Hilton is probably half price).

One thing I particularly dislike is that the hair dryer can not be used in bathroom, only at the desk, cause the outlet in the bathroom does not fit (unless you're bringing your own hair dryer)

Not a bad hotel but not worth the price",Date of stay:

Poor reservation service ended costing us $$ and leaving us disappointed.,"We had a confirmed booking for two room interconnecting which we made by email about eight months prior to our stay. At the time of booking they said an email would be sent three days prior to our stay to make a booking for the roof top pool. We never received an email to make a pool booking so I called the hotel. Turns out they had no record of our booking. They then quoted two rooms (not connecting at a much higher rate than we had initially booked). After getting off the phone, I checked their website and a higher category of room was cheaper than what they have quoted. I asked them why this was and never received a response. I then cancelled the rooms they booked for me and rebooked the higher tier rooms which also included breakfast. When we arrived at the hotel I explained all of the above to the lady who checked us in. I asked why they wouldn't honour the original booking as was quoted. I ended up giving up as the level of compression was limited and when I asked to speak to a manager was told there were none available to talk to. The following day I went to reception to ask for a late check out. In our original booking we had been quoted a half day charge for a 6pm check out. I asked for the same. I was told we could have a late check out but would have to pay the full rate for another day. Confused I asked why and was told they were having a system shut down at 1pm and it was all they could offer. When we arrived they took full payment for the rooms ($2700)plus an extra $100 per room for sundries. When we went to check out my husband not realising I'd already been charged was charged a further $2500. When alerting the receptionist to this we were told the $2700 would be refunded but it could take up to three weeks!

The hotel rooms were nice. The pool was a one time experience which I'm glad to say we have ticked that box.

Would we stay here again? Hell no!",Date of stay:
Top of the world,"Oh boy - this is the one to beat . Now the only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 is that I was on level 6 and the view was non existent and have had better views in Skegness for a lot less money. The room was fantastic and everything clean as you’d expect although I did see a few hairs from the last guest under the loo seat. Having worked as a cleaner I tend to notice things . The rooftop experience was awesome and we seemed to strike lucky with not so many people so had one of the hot tubs to ourselves for ages and no end of choice on loungers.
All the staff were very professional and polite from door men to cleaners ,restaurant staff and reception . The views from the top were awesome as well as the infinity pool . You just have to stay here once in your life .",Date of stay:
Everything perfect,"This is my 4th time stayed at this hotel, everything perfect from the moment you enter, room are beautifully layout, slept well because bed and pillows are so comfortable , friendly staffs especially Daniel the restaurants manager so friend and helpful makes you feel so welcome.

"Our 2nd visit, this place never dissapoints! It is a special place.","What can I say that hasnt already been covered? Marina Bay Sands is simply an incredible destination and is now tradition for my wife and I to spend 1 night of our stay here when we travel to Singapore. Its Iconic and always special when you visit. There is nothing like it in the world.

Last time we had a city view, but this time we had a view of Gardens by the Bay with a balcony which i actually prefer, hundreds of ships to the horizon and good for plane watching too as they fly in to Changi airport.

The pool and skypark is the main attraction ofcourse, and its always spectacular. Poolside food and drink service with that incredible and unique vantage point never gets old.

My last comment is to address the negative comments about price, honestly i have no idea where that comes from, considering there are other top end hotels (Raffles and other big name hotels) that are just as expensive and 2-3x more expensive with rooms that arent as nice as Marina Bay Sands, but simply cannot compete with the experience of the infinity pool and skypark. All things considered I'd say the cost per night is great value for money.

We cant wait to come back next time we are in Singapore!",Date of stay:
Stunning hotel in a beautiful city,"The MBS is simply a stunning hotel. It has an excellent location, with views either towards the magnificent city skyline or the bay and the roof top pool is simply breathtaking. Our room was spacious and immaculate and faced the city skyline. Breakfasts were good but were located at the rooftop restaurant because of renovations, so it was a little hectic. The hotel sits next to the shopping mall complex so there is a wide selection of places to eat. However, there is a coffee shop on the ground floor which is excellent. The nightly light show in the gardens is absolutely stunning.",Date of stay:
5 stars experience !,"So nice !
We stay in this iconic hotel and we loved !

The experience of being in the pool and on the rooftop is spectacular, worth every euro!

During our stay there was a heavy rain with thunderstorm and we were evacuated from the swimming pool. Thanks to Moe - one of the responsible for the infinity pool - for all his care for our safety and for all his explanations.",Date of stay:
Visit to Marine bay area,"Lovely place to visit whilst in Singapore. We walked around the shopping mall and took a boat ride in the middle of the shopping centre on the bottom floor. We had some lunch followed by an indulgence of gelato.
Walked around the marine and visited the Merlin statue than stopped for a drink at one of the many bars. The views of the marina bay sands hotel are amazing. We than waiting for the light display in the evening, worth waiting around for. In all we spent around 6 hours here, but this could be done in 3.
You have the option of hiring bikes to go around the marine if you wish. We were lucky to have some great weather, but when its rains its torrential!.",Date of stay:

A Staycation with the Sands family.,From the time we stepped into the sands lounge to the point of checking out. Our experience was excellent. We had the opportunity to utilise the club55 lounge and the service and attention shown was very personal. Ordering in room dinning was a pleasure too with food arriving in neatly storage larders. And the attentiveness of the staff ensured that nothing was left to chance. Having our breakfast at the Rise restaurant was also left with fond memories and pleasant experiences. With Your staff Paula ensuring that a simple order of orange Juice was not left to chance but she personally handled the order and took the trouble to locate me amidst the buffet area to assure me that my order had been placed and was on its way. Our experience in the infinite pool was also greeted with staff that were polite and life guard Ryan helping my children find their way to the family pool and helping us to have fond memories.,Date of stay:
Stayed for two nights. The hotel is way overpriced. The only advantage that you have being a hotel guest is access to the swimm,"The hotel is way overpriced. There are far better hotels at lower prices. The only advantage of Marina Sands is the swimming pool access. But even if you are not a hotel guest, you can still be on top of the hotel visiting one of the restaurants. We booked two nights for my wife's birthday, and despite the fact that I had it specifically mentioned in the reservation, there was nothing birthday related in our room. I had to call them, and then we got a piece of cake with a candle. If you decide to stay at the hotel, don't book breakfast because they don't have the capacity to cover all their guests. If you still decide to book a breakfast, make sure you show before 09:00 or, you will wait least 30 minutes on a line, and still you not guaranteed that you will be seated. Talking about Spago, the queue at the Rise restaurant was even bigger. Most of the staff are overworked and not very polite. The hotel is too big and definitely not worth the money for the quality of service that they offer. Before moving to that one, we stayed 5 nights at Conrad Centenial, and we regretted that we booked the Marina Sands.",Date of stay:
Long checkin wait,"Slowest checkin process I have seen for a large hotel. Allow yourself 1 hour for checkin, definitely more on holidays and weekends. Hotel itself is average and is showing its age. Each person checkin is about 10-20 mins for some unknown reason",Date of stay:
Stay at Marina Bay Sands,"First time at Marina Bay Sands.

I wanted to stay someone nice and also was attracted to the swimming pool.

The rooms were clean. I had a nice view of the Gardens By the Bay.

We got there early and was provided early check in. Our departure flight was late and we got a late check out on one room. This was a good help as we have a baby with us.

The staff were so good and friendly - door staff, Check In, Luggage and Concierge.

I didn't find the staff at the Rise reception very friendly - they hardly even said Good morning.

Hotel is close to the Airport and many attractions. Also close to Gardens By the Bay.

The Breakfast was good at Rise, but average at Spago.

The Pool was fun.",Date of stay:
Great staff and amazing views and pool......thats about it,"We had an enjoyable stay in March, but I doubt we will stay again. Dont get me wrong, the hotel is amazing, all the staff we dealt with were great, and the views from the higher rooms are wonderful. The pool was incredible but quite full, and no umbrellas by the sun loungers, so get very hot, very quickly. We had to leave early for a flight, so we didnt stay for breakfast.
We also stayed at The Clan hotel in Singapore as well, and I can honestly say, I enjoyed my stay there more than MBS.
The Clan had everything MBS had, at one third of the price, and without the crowds.",Date of stay:

Our favorite hotel experience,"We were lucky enough to have a premier suite experience as our anniversary. It was a fantastic room with a beautiful view to the gardens by the bay. The view from the infinity pool was also immaculate! We used a ton of different amenities, but the gym, sauna, steam room, and hot tub was one of our favorites.

During check in, we met our new favorite staff member of any hotel. Jerry, who worked at the Sands Lounge, was very informative and knowledgeable of everything we asked him. He was so kind and patient with us. He made sure we had a smooth and welcoming check in, directed us on how to get to our room, and made sure to let us know we could call if we had any additional questions. Our trip in Singapore definitely was elevated because of him! If you’re lucky enough to meet him, you’ll be in really good hands.

Overall, the hotel was a blast. Every other staff member we met was really friendly.",Date of stay:
Great stay with great views of the city,Very cool hotel in the heart of Singapore. We stayed three nights with our family and had a great time. Especially liked the location near the gardens and all the shopping. The rooms could be a little bigger and more appointed for the price but ton of dining options.

What makes this place more special is when we swim in the infinity pool. Nothing can beat the beautiful sceneries here. I would like to thank the pool team staffs Christy (morning time) Maricon and Reg (evening time) who made us feel so comfortable and safe during our stay in the pool area especially with my 35weeks pregnancy bump. Their service was impeccable, the energy of the atmosphere was great. Thank you guys.

Amazing hotel & Spectacular views,"Wow! The Marina Bay Sands is an amazing hotel, we were greeted by someone very friendly and chatty at the door who took our luggage and took us inside, I had previously signed up to the marina bay sands rewards scheme so I went to get my card (the desk is opposite check in at tower 1) whilst my partner stood in the queue to check in to our room, there was a bit of a queue but all in all check in went very smoothly and quickly, I had filled in a form via email with some check in details which I think made things go quicker. There was also a man giving out bottles of water while we were in the queue, the staff were lovely and made us feel so welcome.
We checked in at Tower 1 (There is also a check in at Tower 3 but it closes at 5pm ) Our room was in Tower 3 floor 45 room 4519, we stayed 3 nights and we had a Deluxe King Harbour View room, which faces the sea and also faces gardens by the bay and the view was spectacular!! You have to see the view to believe it and at night time it’s even better, our room was also a sunrise view room, we ordered breakfast room service to be delivered at 7.30am and was delivered on time. Breakfast was delivered and set up on a table for us and was so lovely to watch sunrise whilst eating breakfast, we didn’t eat breakfast at the restaurant as our room was booked without and to add buffet breakfast was $61 or $53 to prebook, I should mention breakfast is till 11am for room service and you have the option to order individual items which is cheaper than the Buffet Breakfast, mind you there are plenty of places to eat breakfast in the centre or at the hawker market which is nearby.
Considering how big the hotel is the staff were so lovely and friendly and make you feel so welcome, there is even a place to get an umbrella in case it rains. The Infinity Pool was amazing and mesmerising, let me tell you it’s definitely worth a stay at this amazing hotel, yes it’s busy and sometimes you get lost with the excitement but it’s worth every penny, the building and the views in this hotel are spectacular, the room was comfortable with a shower and everything included, robes slippers coffee tea and coffee machine, bathroom amenities by Roberto Cavali, everything you could need, water was given to us for free also.
We had lunch at the pool which also has waiter service and the prices were reasonable.
We even ate at Lavo restaurant which was so delicious. Staying at this hotel is an experience you will never forget.

A dream fulfilled,"I have been wanting to stay at this hotel ever since it opened back in 2012 and am still in awe that I have seen and stayed at this magnificent structure.

The hotel staff are extremely nice and friendly. Although it took a considerable amount to check in (my poor 10 year old had motion sickness from the flight was nauseous). Simply exchange money took 5-10 minutes with all of these antiquated forms the staff needed to complete.

Upon check-in to the room ......wow! The room was amazing and the views of the city were stunning. The room was much larger than I expected and the staff was nice to add a rollaway bed.

The breakfast at Spago was so-so.

At 8am, we already made our way to the pool before the rush. Early morning, there aren't a lot of people. I made it there before my family got ready and got stunning pictures. The staff were so friendly, especially KJ who took plenty of pics of me and said his job is to make us happy. he sure made us happy and memories for life.

The water was a bit cold at that hour, but the views were unparalleled and some of the best in the world. We still couldn't believe we were staying at the Marina Bay Sands resort. We cherished every moment.

The smiles on all of the workers faces really made us feel good. They went above the call of duty to make us feel good.

We only spent two nights here and the following day, our flight was early before breakfast would open. The hotel organized room service for us with so many items that I lost count and didn't charge us extra for it. It's little touches like this that made our experience such a delightful one.

I dreamed of this place for over a decade and it lives up the expectations! We made memories for life!",Date of stay:
Fabulous birthday celebrations,"It has always been a dream to stay at Marina Bay Sands, and for my husbands birthday we stayed in a Garden view room on floor 30. The room is modern, spacious and very clean with the largest TV, I have ever seen in a hotel room. But this room is all about the view. You can see the Singapore flyer to the left, all the ships out at sea, right around to the cruise ship port. Then right in front of you is the beautiful Gardens by the Bay, which are stunning by day and night.
The shops and the restaurants are wonderful. We had the best Italian meal ever at Lavo
(Also reviewed) which is on the top of the building. Stunning views of the city and the light show below.
Then there is the pool. You have to be staying at the hotel to use the pool and with 2,561 rooms with let’s say 2 per room, around 5,000 potential users, sounds impossible. The pool is 142 meters long, the longest infinity pool in the world. It opens 6am to 11pm. (no need to book) It has an adults only section and family section. We visited the pool at night 9-11 and during the day 3-5. It never once felt too busy or over crowded, in fact it had a lovely relaxing atmosphere.
But it is the people who work at this hotel that make the stay extra special. Everyone is friendly and happy to help make your visit the best experience for you.",Date of stay:
Incredible honeymoon stay,Stayed here for the first leg of our honeymoon. This hotel really is spectacular and worth every penny. We were very kindly upgraded to a suite on the 53rd floor which was super appreciated. The view was phenomenal and the room was bigger than our house! The room was always kept clean and had all the facilities and amenities we needed. We enjoyed the pool and used it a couple of times to see the view at nighttime and during the day. Would always now stay at this hotel when visiting Singapore.,Date of stay:
Hugely disappointing,"The hotel itself is so vast it feels like a shopping centre.
Rooms are average, a similar level to the Fullerton and Park Royale, despite the latter two being a fraction of the price. My room was a lower level so I view (and noise) from the road both sides.
Room service is crazily overpriced.

The most overrated hotel experience?,"Marina Bay Sands is definitely a bucketlist destination but having stayed there once we would never head back.

Don’t get me wrong the building is impressive, views breathtaking, the room was magnificent and the SkyPool is an amazing engineering feat. I found the staff hugely attentive and very friendly, but it was the frictions and irritations along the journey that soured the experience.

From a slow, we’d say painful check in, to long queues for well just about everything (pool lounge, breakfast table, etc.) and so overpriced. We had a spa experience in the Banyan Tree which was nice but not worth the price tag attached.

The one standout experience for me was aBirthday Dinner at LAVO. The food was great, the service excellent, cocktails expertly mixed and a complimentary birthday dessert a very thoughtful touch.

It is curious that it looks like a ship atop the towers as the experience really reminded me of being on a budget cruise. Maybe scheduled breakfast slots, staggered check in and and lower costs of food and drinks might make the experience more enjoyable.

Anyway been there done that, but not again at that price!",Date of stay:

Unforgettable birthday weekend!,"I booked the High Life package as a gift for my husband’s 30th birthday. Before booking I had a lot of questions which the members of staff at MBS were more than happy to help me with. After an initial conversation, I decided it would be the perfect way to celebrate his birthday. I was given lots of birthday options for how the room could be decorated. This whole process was seamless.

A few days before our stay, Mark reached out to me to help with any reservations I wanted to make and to ask if there’s anything else the team could do to make our stay special.

The pick up service was very punctual and our journey to the hotel was super comfortable - a great way to begin our stay! Mark greeted us at the car door and talked us through the hotel, the restaurants, timings and escorted us to our room.

The room was incredible! Immaculate - with views of Gardens by the Bay, the Supertrees as well as the city. Mark and his team had left a handwritten birthday message and cake (which was absolutely delicious) for my husband. Needless to say, my husband was very surprised! Mark gave us a tour of the room and then left us to get settled in.

During our stay, Mark checked in on us several times to ensure we were having the best experience. He responded to any messages or questions I had within minutes.

My husband definitely had the best weekend celebrating. His review for the hotel and the team is below:
Thank you everyone at MBS for an incredible birthday weekend. The service provided by Mark and his team was unlike anything we’ve ever experienced elsewhere. We were picked up in a car from our accommodation and taken to the hotel, here we were greeted by Mark and Rosie and welcomed into the hotel. We were taken directly to our room to be shown around. The room itself was amazing, the best hotel room we have ever stayed in and would definitely recommend to anyone. Mark and team were so kind, they set up happy birthday balloons in our bedroom, provided a cake as well as a hand written message wishing me happy birthday and a wonderful weekend. It was truly an unforgettable weekend, the hotel itself is well worth the money and we loved every minute of our weekend there. The highlights being the view from our room, the infinity pool, the restaurants, the spa and the surrounding Marina Bay area.

MBS is the epitome of a true 5-Star hotel!,"MBS is indeed topnotch all the way! A five-star rating is an under-statement. Their attention to detail and responsiveness to customers are beyond expectation. The Premier suite is worth every penny. The suite is the definition of luxury and elegance. I usually carry my own hair dryer every time I travel. But this time I did not have to use it because MBS Premier Suite has the dyson hair dryer. From the amenities, toiletries, robes, slippers, beddings - everything is topnotch! But what impressed me the most is their excellent customer service. Shoutout to Mark! He was there during our check-in and he was also there to bid us goodbye when we left and made sure that our stay was as comfortable as possible. He booked our transportation; followed up on everything we need. He is a real gem! Thank you Mark and to all the staff at MBS, you guys made our stay most memorable and satisfying. It was an experience we will always treasure.",Date of stay:

We where cared for by manageress Ghigie and her wonderful staff especially Riza so bubbly she was infectious you just had to smilr. I had to mention these staff as they were exceptional but the whole team are so good all made us welcome and our stay memorable. I feel quality of staff that spend time with customers make the holiday complete. We will be back,Date of stay:
A stay at the orchid suite,"Check-in at vip was fast even though we were early. Offered later checkout and they booked transportation to the airport at the check-in. Got some complementary coffee and coke while waiting (though added on the bill later on). Really nice big room even if its getting old. Wished a high floor and got 54. Amazing city view from the room. Great service and staff at club 55 that were very friendly when arriving. And free ameneties is always nice with mini-bar included. Cleaning staff didnt know english, so hard to explain, and room service dropped bread on floor and left pieces which when we noticed didnt get cleaned so we had to pick it up from the carpet. Great laundry service. Pool amazing, unfortunately rather bad weather the 4 days we stayed.
Its a bit pricey for the orchid suite but love to visit again.
Close to MRT station and some of the more famous attractions and food centre close by if too expensive.",Date of stay:
Best hotel and service ever,"Simply amazing stay at truly the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at. From the super friendly staff to the amazing food amenities and of course “that pool” , it was truly a magical stay. We received an upgraded room without even asking and felt like celebrities 😂😂",Date of stay:
Worth EVERY penny!!!!!!!!! 5 Stars!!!!!!,"What better way to spend my 50th birthday than at the iconic Marina Bay Sands! It was soooo worth the 17 hr flight from San Francisco to get here! We were greeted warmly by the staff and instantly felt their excitement for our stay. The room was worth every penny spent! The room was warm and inviting- with top of the line amenities! Nespresso coffee, upscale snacks, and best of all…. An automated toilet complete with bidet and heated seat!!!!!!! (My husband’s favorite part of the room! 😂) The pool is incredible and needs a review of its own!!!!!! If you’re willing to splurge on yourself…. The Marina Bay Sands will not disappoint!!!!! 5 stars from me and my husband and we will definitely return for future celebrations!!!!!!",Date of stay:
Luxury,"Luxos hotel with a beautiful view of the business center and gardens by the bay. Hotel restaurants at a very high level. A week is not enough to try everything;) The view from the infinity pool unforgettable. Highly recommend, especially the rooms above the 40th floor.",Date of stay:
Out expectations were not met - but service top notch. A little style over substance.,"Where to begin... Our sons (now 11 and 8) chose this hotel as their post COVID holiday after watching the BBC Race Across the World programme. All they wanted was the infinity pool - and that didn't disappoint (although why is is not heated??!). We went straight off the back of 7 nights at an amazing 5* hotel in Thailand and this was pipped to the the highlight of our stay. However we left feeling a little disappointed.

Pre arrival communication excellent and helped me arrange treats for my husband's birthday. We were apprehensive about the check in process after friends and colleagues stating how long it took, however they took one look at my husband on crutches with a broken leg, and whisked us into the guest lounge, which while took an age to check in (40 mins), we were sat down with coffee and the kids with lollies and drinks, which was very much welcomed.

We were in a Deluxe King Sky View as it had a sofa bed for the kids, and the room was HUGE with the most amazing views. However the room itself was very basic. We likened it to a Premier Inn (UK based will know what that comparison means). It was a little dated but functional The biggest letdown was the sofa bed. It was the cheapest, most uncomfortable bed we've come across in all our years of travelling (and we travel a lot). The mattress was about 5-7cm deep and the kids could feel every spring as they sat on the bed and rolled over. We had to ask for an extra duvet just for them to lie on so they could sleep. Not acceptable in a 5* hotel.

But our biggest issue was the SMELL. The smell as you walked through reception as divine but our floor, despite being non smoking, stunk like a working mens club from the 1980s. Each time we opened our door or stepped out of the lift, the smell of smoke hit you and we were on a no smoking floor. Why hotels in this day and age allow smoking I don't know, but it was vile.

On the plus side, the service was superb. From the reception staff to the roof top bars, you were always greeted with a smile and a welcome. Everyone went out of their way to help you. We didn't have a great experience in the Rise buffet (see separate review) but loved the ability to come out of your room and be in the mall within 5 mins.

A big shout out to the lifeguard on the roof terrace (forgotten his name but used to work on the cruise ships out of Southampton, UK) - he was a delight to talk to and cheered us up each morning we went for a swim.

Would we return? No, I think we'd head to the Fullerton or Raffles this time.",Date of stay:
Definitely the best hotel in Singapore,"Everything went smooth from the time we checked in until we left. Food was amazing. Service is efficient during my stay. Love the view from the infinity pool. The staff are wonderful especially Fir, Ravi & Reggine. They are very helpful, approachable & serve beyond their duties and ensured all the plans are in order. That says a lot about the high quality work that they doing with the team and the hotel. No regrets and definitely will be visiting again.",Date of stay:
Marina Bay Sands Hotel experience,"A person I know stayed here and thought it was great so I had to do the same.

The design of the building is fascinating and a great landmark in Singapore for kms around. The top part which looks like a boat is the famous pool with a view to die for and a bar in the middle. I absolutely had to try it out but it was cold in the water and only 21o or so out. Freezing!

Even though I paid about $AUD 800 per night the $52 breakfast was extra! So we went elsewhere for it.

There is a pedestrian walkway to the MBS Shopping Centre which is handy although the food court is a good 15 min walk.

On the ground floor there are shops and restaurants.

Would stay here again but not good value for money where the brekky's concerned as I've paid a similar rate at other places and got brekky.",Date of stay:
Hospitality needs to be improved,"We were staying in Room 4101 from 26.10.22 to 29.10.22 & found service very poor. Water was served in broken glass, food was served without covering. After complaining 3 times, glass was changed after 20-25 mins. No regrets from hotel side. This shows poor hospitality.
Hotel is pretty good, luxurious & at prime location. Options for pure vegetarians & indian foods are very less. This needs to be taken care off. Better to stay only 1 night to enjoy INFINITY POOL. Nothing more great about it.",Date of stay:
Spectacular view and memorable experience,"Be prepared to queue for your check-in. We waited for about 20-30mins to check into this 5 star hotel. The hotel lobby area is big and looks like it can be access by lots of walk-in non-hotel guests as well, there are not enough seats for hotel guests. Room is big and comfortable. We came to Marina Bay Sands to enjoy the view from the room. and that we have achieved. The view from the gym, bar and infinity is spectacular. Highly commendable are the hotel staff - very friendly, respectful and helpful.",Date of stay:
Simply excellent,We stayed on a Sunday night to celebrate my partner's birthday while we were in Singapore and the experience we had was simply breathtaking! Upon checking-in we were greeted by Shataz who took us up to our room and made us feel right at home. Shataz's warm and friendly nature made us feel very comfortable and nothing was too much of an ask. A big slab of chocolate cake and a candle was on the table for my partner for her birthday which was a lovely touch. Showers were made available for us after checkout and before going to the airport which was very convenient. We can not thank Mark and Shataz and the team enough for their excellent hospitality and definitely recommend staying at MBS!,Date of stay:
Nothing short of perfect,"All we can say is WOW.

To the Marina bay sands team, thank you (especially Abdul Rahman) The food we had for lunch at Spago was honestly unbelievable.

We come from a country where we are known to have some of the best food, and I can honestly say Spago was up there with one of the best restaurants we’ve ever eaten at in all our travels.

The views, the pool, the experience, the convenience and the transport was all 10/10.

Don’t bother to look anywhere else when coming to Singapore, this hotel is iconic for a reason. The rooms were fully equipped with the coolest technological features I’ve ever seen and the whole place is nothing short of luxurious in every way.

Thank you MBS, we will defiantly be back. A big big thank you to Abdul Rahman, he is an asset to the team and is a very large reason for the amazing experience we had.",Date of stay:
Marina Bay Sands,"I have stopped here before and must say it’s simply spectacular and something I’ll remember fondly. The rooms are spacious, clean and I was lucky enough to have access to the pool as well as club 55 for drinks and nibbles. Absolutely superb!

I am due to return in a couple of days and am trying to find out if alcohol is still included in the lounge or not? I messaged concierge but am yet to hear back from them. If anyone knows, I’d be extremely grateful if they could let me know :-)",Date of stay:
Beautiful Hotel,Singapore is such a beautiful place to go and the hotel was great. It has very nice view and the facilities was just nice. Its been so long since my wife and I travelled but there was a nice lady name Sha helped us at the reception answering all out enquiries. It was a lovely stay and friendly people around.,Date of stay:
Amazing hotel!!,Fantastic hotel with a huge variety of food outlets and activities. Great rooms with great views across the bay and bay gardens. Go for a high floor room to get the views. Also recommend KOMA Japanese restaurant.,Date of stay:
Huge hotel complex with a great view,"We stayed here for 4 nights. We had no idea that the restaurants would be so busy and it would be so hard to book once we were here, so book ahead!
We ate in both Lavo and Cest la vie and had good meals in both.. the prices are extortionate though for what you are eating. Cest la vie’s menu is pretty limited too. We had a drink afterward in their sky bar which was really nice with that great view.
Breakfast the first day, what a queue! We had to wait half an hour.. one of their restaurants, Rise is being refurbished so one less restaurant for breakfast… (my advice come early) we skipped it the next day but had had it the last 2 days and the queues were better but we were earlier. Breakfast was ok, nothing special.
The staff are all lovely, we didn’t encounter not one unhelpful or miserable member.
The pool - well what can I say about that big pool with that great view, not bad waiter service and comfy loungers.. just lovely. People were out there until late at night relaxing and having food on the loungers.
The room was spacious, great showers and plenty of products.. the bed was pretty hard though and sadly the complimentary fridge only had a few cans of sugary fizzy drinks.. we left a note for our housekeeper to swap them for sugar free drinks but no luck.. I tried again for our last day and bingo two coke zeros..
We thought we’d try the casino one evening and what a palava, passports, your Singapore entry form then their face recognition couldn’t match me to my passport .. any how we nearly have up as we are not gamblers, we just wanted to have a quick go at roulette. Any how we finally got in.. it was ok… similar to the Hippodrome in leciester square being leant on and pushed out the way so players could put their bets on..
It has a walk way to get to the Garden by the Bay which was very handy. We could also see the light shows, one from our room and one from the Cest la vie bar.
The hotel is massive… shops, museum, theatre the lot. It’s spotless and seems really well run. We had a very pleasant 4 night stay.",Date of stay:
Singapore or sing for more,"The Marina Bay Sands is a beautiful hotel, but the rooms are over priced and disappointing. The roof top infinity pool should be heated, but its not and as many guests ventured in to get that must have photo, the look on their faces was priceless. At the prices they charge here the Marina Bay Sands should and could do better. It was an enjoyable few days but we left feeling somewhat disappointed.",Date of stay:
Be prepared to queue for everything,"Room was very nice and tastefully decorated.
Hotel was very clean and staff we had contact with were helpful and friendly
Pool cold and full of people taking selfies although it obviously is an “experience”
Our issue was with the constant need to queue for everything including breakfast - over 30 mins. Unable to get anywhere to eat or drink in hotel or attached shopping complex unless you have booked - even then we struggled to find anywhere two days ahead. Nowhere in hotel you can sit and just get a drink when raining - never had to book to get into a bar!
So many people and not enough basic facilities
Queues at 6am to check out too
Definitely an experience but won’t be returning",Date of stay:

Great experience!,"Our family enjoyed the stay! We went for Frozen musical. It is a right decision to stay at MBS as it is convenient. Easy access to theatre, shops, restaurants, MRT... We like the infinity pool, but it is windy & cold for my 9yo daughter. If you bring children there, be prepared to keep them warm. Restaurants are always busy, it is best to make reservation up front. We drove & the Valet parking service (daily rate with multiple entries) is very useful (because the carpark is quite a distance) & reasonably priced. Easy to get staff assistance at Tower 1 lobby area & Tower 3 pick up / drop off points. Staff are very friendly, helpful & well-trained. We were assigned a Premium Serivces agent during check-in & felt being taken care!",Date of stay:
Iconic,"It was always an ambition to stay here and finally achieved it. A lovely hotel and just our style, modern & comfortable. The roof top pool is a must and it’s lovely to lay by the pool and take a dip and enjoy the view. The gym is small for the size of the hotel but it always had space when we visited. The buffet restaurant was good but nearly always busy. We were in a suite but unlike other similar hotels they didn’t have an executive lounge for snacks etc,shame!",Date of stay:
Special to Guna at Marina Bay Sand infinity pool,I stay Marina Bay sand hotel for 3 days 2 night. First day when I came to the pool and intended to order some bites and drink for my family. I raise my hand and waited for about half an hour but no one serve me even they saw. After that Guna came here and serve us. We ordered few times and we was far away from the counter to order. And he still patiently serve us even we have a lot request. 2nd day when we come. Still is him who serve us. Wanted to know how come no others ppl working while I sees most of them are just walking around without serving customer. Wanted to give him a very good thumb up. And service was really good.,Date of stay:
mixed experience,"On the positive side, the hotel has stunning city skyline views and easy access to many of Singapore's top attractions. However, the room is a little bit outdated.

GREAT SERVICE FROM JOANNE OF PS!,"I would like to Thank Joanne of PS Team for her superb service. It was a top notch service from her. From my arrival down to my check out, She really did a job well done. I feel like she is 24/7 available. Everytime I ask a silly question, she is always there to help. A great Gem in your company.

Memorable Experience,"We booked this stay to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. This was also the first time traveling with our 1 year old son to Asia. After a long 19hr direct flight from NYC, we were tired and didn't have any expectations. As soon as we arrived, we were blown away with the service and the kindness of the staff. We arrived early at 8am but our room wasn't ready yet, so they suggested we visit the gardens and they will text us when the room is ready. At 11AM, we got the text and check-in was smooth and quick. The room was clean, and everyday we had our fridge and water stocked. One thing I do want to compliment is the hotel keeping their policy of the infinity pool is for guest only. This was a major reason why we booked all 6 nights at the hotel and with the price we paid for our stay, we definitely appreciate them enforcing this policy. We noticed a few individuals trying to take advantage of their infinity pool. I've overheard guest who are asking for ""extra"" room cards in the lobby because they ""lost"" theirs or individuals trying to intimidate their way in by saying they ""left"" their cards in the room and shouldn't have to go back and get it etc. This was one of our favorite hotels that we've stayed at and everyone at the hotel made it a memorable experience for us.",Date of stay:

"Great hotel, service, and location!","We were nervous on whether we should stay here or another hotel in Singapore. People had told us that it was a big like Las Vegas or Disneyland - and let me tell you - it was better! First of all, you can't beat the location. It's perfect in every way - just Google it! The Concierge team was excellent - they helped us with anything we wanted to do at any time. They gave us ideas, and even met us during breakfast to walk us through ideas of how to spend our days. The large and best mall is connected to the hotel, and the MRT (Subway) is just downstairs from the hotel. They have great restaurants in the hotel and in the connected mall - and an amazing food court/hawker stands! You can see the light show in the fountain and the Supertree Grove. We stayed in Tower 2 - which is the newly renovated tower. THE POOL was LOVELY! This was also a highlight - and it's only for guests. When the weather was nice - we would take a break and just hang out at the pool. The sunsets are beautiful. You can get food and drinks at the pool also. We also had drinks on the rooftop and that was really nice as well - and something I would also recommend.

OVERALL - the answer is YES! Stay here if you are visiting Singapore! We have to go back through Singapore to catch our flight back to US - and we can't imagine staying anywhere else for our last night in Singapore!",Date of stay:
Enjoyable staycation,"We stayed at MBS Tower One level 43 from 15 to 17 February 2023 and the view was beautiful. Although there was some minor unpleasantness during check-in, the experience was quickly rectified by one MR LEE from the hotel’s operation team. We were impressed by the swift action taken by MR LEE to resolve the issue we experienced upon checking in, which was in less than an hour after our feedback via email. This incident reflected how MBS prioritizes guests’ feedbacks and is making every efforts to make right what went wrong.",Date of stay:
Best Hotel & Service ever experienced!,"The best stay and experience at a hotel ww have ever had. We are a family of 4 with kids age 13 and 11 and got one of the newly renovated premium 2 bed suites. (Room 1990). Wow, just an incredible room, the children had their own double beds, we had a cinema room with karaoke, the views, the beds, the butler service who were so attentive and kind (Jacob, rasul and Raien) and the attention to detail was just too class. We have stayed in other luxury 5/6 star hotels around the globe, this has to be our favourite. An absolute must visit, you will not be disappointed. Thank you to Paul, Wange and the incredible MBS butler team for the most wonderful stay and special memory.",Date of stay:
One of a kind,"This place is certainly unique and huge. Having said that it was no problem to get sun lounges at the infinity pool. The pool is the the big draw card and a bucket list experience, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Pool service was good but we’ve had better cocktails elsewhere. All the staff were impeccably polite and helpful. My partner was given a complimentary mocktail and some chocolates for a birthday surprise, which was a lovely gesture. We had a deluxe garden view room on level 29 in Tower 3. This tower was not currently having renovations so all was quiet. The room itself is ok, nothing flash, the bathroom is nice. Origin & Bloom has the best coffee we had in our 9 day trip and the ladies there are lovely. The only thing to question is whether it’s value for money. We paid more here for a basic room than we did for suites at both The Intercontinental and Swissotel the Stamford. As it was a special occasion we splashed out and did it. Would we go again? If we won lotto and could afford a suite.",Date of stay:
Loved it and highly recommend,"Absolutely amazing! I loved the level of service provided in the entire hotel. At the infinity pool, Moe (lifeguard), was exceptional. He was very professional, attentive, had sense of urgency, and knows how to make a customer feel welcomed.

Amazing Stay,"Checked into MBS 2 weeks ago with my husband and little one. While waiting for my check in, i approached a guy with black suits enquiry about the hotel facilities. Daniel from Premium Services attended to me and we have a quick conversation but in detailed.

I was amazed with the little gesture from him and being patience for my enquiries even he was waiting for his VIP guest. Thank you Daniel! Look forward to stay in MBS again!",Date of stay:
MBS - one of the nicest & unique places of the world,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands again for 4 days. From arrival to departure, it was a single experience. We already knew the luxurious house. This time we were able to get to know a unique service. We were picked up directly after arrival at the gate and accompanied to the hotel, had a limousine - it couldn't be better. Once we arrived at the hotel, we were already welcomed by an excellently trained employee who took over all the formalities for us and accompanied us to our suite. Here we were made aware of various things. For the duration of our stay, this employee took care of everything, including the luggage that did not arrive in Singapore. That was a unique service and we were thrilled from the first moment - it couldn't be better and we thank you very much for that. We can only recommend this wonderful house. We can afford this house, should definitely try it out and will not be disappointed at all.",Date of stay:
Fantastic infinity pool with a great view!,"An overnight stay in the hotel is worthwhile just to be able to enjoy the inifinity pool with its mega view. The service staff is extremely friendly. A special thank you to Shirly from Pool Service for her super friendly and attentive service.

Staff greets warmly with a smile. They communicate well. From the bell service, room attendant to front office staff. A huge thanks to Mr. Andre for a fantastic check in. He is kind enough to upgrade us to a suite room with a choice of view. We chose to stay facing the gardens by the bay. Mr. Jerry also did a warm check out. Staff are attentive. Room is clean and comfortably perfect.

Highlight of our stay is the iconic infinity pool at the top of the hotel, truly worthy to end our stay at Singapore. Wish to be back soon.",Date of stay:
Marina Bay Sands Serious Disappointment.,1 would be too high a rating for this place. Huge overrated attraction. Was meant to be the highlight of our Far East Tour. Accept that the weather is an uncontrolled animal. But a huge venue who could not offer us a drink anywhere. Poor. Save your money and go to Raffles Hotel instead. Excellent service. Wonderful drinks. MBS is a circus.,Date of stay:
Meets the high expectations,"There are some places you book and you have a clear idea of what you think it will be like - marina bay sands delivered on our expectations.

Most amazing view of Singapore skyline,"We stayed at Marina bay sands for 3 nights. The hotel has some of the best night clubs of Singapore. It has a shopping mall, casino, multiple international restaurants and is well connected to metro station. We enjoyed every bit our stay there with most cherished experience being swim in the infinity pool which provides a unique view of the Singapore skyline. It's highly recommended to reserve the table at the night clubs and restaurants in advance as it's difficult to get a seat on spot. There is also some construction work going on in tower 2 so one might hear some noise therefore its recommended to get a city view room at tower 3",Date of stay:
2017 Late Review- found my handbag and couriered to Sydney . Superb.,"I’ve been meaning to write this review for 6 years, and always tell friends and family what a fantastic experience I had. The main reason for my review was because of how proactive and helpful the staff were. I left my handbag in a taxi on the way to the airport. It was just a standard unbooked taxi. I was distraught and tried everything to find the taxi when at the airport. The hotel checked the cctv, time, asked what I was wearing and managed to find the driver. The handbag was then couriered over (at my cost) to Sydney where I was staying. Absolutely first class service!",Date of stay:
A totally impressive hotel,"An impressive building, with stunning views. Staying here felt like an experience of a lifetime . Everything was seriously tip top and a thoroughly enjoyable visit. Rooms were great with great views. Views from top floor were even better and then there is the pool, which is impressive. A great hotel.",Date of stay:
Vegas experience in Singapore,"Very beautiful hotel in Singapore with some of the same pros and cons of a large Las Vegas hotel/casino. Beautiful Disneyland like property but terribly slow service at bars and restaurants. Slow as in sometimes an hour or more just to have a server visit for the first time after initial seating!

Room: Clean with a nice view. We stayed in 5010 overlooking the Gardens by the Bay. Perfect air con and clean room with free bottled water replaced daily. Solid and attentive housekeeping

Service: We didn’t require much non-dining service. Pre-arrival emails were very promptly responded to. Check in was really slow, but friendly. They can definitely improve the check in process to make it faster, but this was a very minor inconvenience. Bellmen were awesome.

Gym: Beautiful and busy, as to be expected for such a large hotel. Plentiful equipment of all types. One of the most well equipped gyms I have seen at a hotel. Friendly staff and an amazing view. Great weight selections with dumbbells up to 80 pounds and unlimited barbell plates.

Dining: So many great options. All were very good from food and drink perspective. But the service is incredibly slow at the rooftop restaurants Ce La Vi and Spago. Way understaffed. Up to an hour or more just to place an order on some occasions (once we waited 80 minutes and then walked to the bar to order drinks ourselves because we had not yet seen a server!!!). Be prepared for long waits to receive any service. Might be ok if you want to spend 5 hours on your meal. Views on rooftop restaurants are amazing though so that helps. But it can be really hot and humid so long waits at the outdoor restaurants and bars can become uncomfortable after awhile.

Pool: Beautiful views but crowded and no shade/umbrellas/cabanas. Can get really hot.

WiFi: Free and perfect, no issues.

Overall: Excellent location and beautiful views. Some items that can be improved upon on the service side, but it was a great experience overall and I would not hesitate to stay here again and work myself around the slow service issues by perhaps dining elsewhere or being more proactive and vocal about service right at the time of initial seating.",Date of stay:
"Excellent staff, infinity pool is amazing","Thanks to Singapore Airlines rebooking our flight, we ended up with a night in Singapore and decided to splurge and try the Marina Bay Sands. This with the famous infinity pool has been on my bucket list, and as we were celebrating our anniversary it seemed perfect.

From arrival to departure the staff were on the whole excellent. The receptionist on check-in was very accommodating of our late flight the next day, and gave us a later checkout. As the booked room type wasn't available, we were upgraded to a suite on the top floor!

The bags were delivered to the room - or should I say suite! It was quite impressive with two balconies, two massive TVs, a huge spacious bathroom with bathtub. The bed turned out to be extremely comfortable. Other nice touches were the included minibar containing juices and soft drinks, and that the staff came up with a cake denoting our anniversary - thank you!

There were a few minor negatives with the room, the first being the smell of stale smoke. It was stated that this was a non-smoking room, but people have clearly smoked in there. While the room and surfaces felt clean, there was some black mold on the ceiling of the shower that I would not have expected from a hotel of this class.

The infinity pool (Skydeck) area is awesome. Plenty of sun loungers and towels, along with good staff. Didn't try any of the restaurants on this level, but did make the ""mistake"" of going down to the observation deck a few floors down. Don't do this - the view is not much different from what you get on the top floor, and you are surrounded by tourists.

I found the changing facilities and toilets on the level below to be a little meh with no proper place to change and not super clean (again, in comparison to the rest of the hotel)

Overall a very enjoyable stay, although everything in MBS is expensive.",Date of stay:
Memorable experience.,"A birthday’s treat to stay two nights in this iconic hotel. All the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, especially Grace who arranged a few special treats for my birthday, I was very grateful.
Fabulous view from floor 35 of the gardens and all the ships at anchor. We were glad that we walked into the gardens on the first night to see the light show as it was better from underneath, and it rained the following night.
My only niggle is that the children have a large area of pool, in fact the whole of the infinity pool I believe, and there is only one small area of sun chairs and jacuzzi’s designated adult only. This was not watched over by staff so we frequently had young kids in the jacuzzi and running around and screaming which spoilt the experience.",Date of stay:
Superstar treatment for an ordinary family,"Thanks to Mark and his team to make our family trip to Marina Bay Sands truly pleasant and light-hearted.

We were caught by surprise right at the door step of the hotel when Mark and his team meet us at the hotel entrance and supervised us directly to our rooms, making our first time in room check-in experience memorial and careless as we did not have to queue up in the lobby, tired and restless after a long flight with the infant in our hands, but instead were supervised directly to the room, where we could directly take a relax. A big kudos to the hotel team to have such service, especially very helpful for big families after long flight. Just that experience made me feel like the room charge per night was totally worth the price.

After a quick and easy in room check-in, we realised that we forgot the baby stroller in the airport. We were offered a free limousine service by the hotel to go and come back to the airport to pick up the lost baby stroller. I was even escorted by the driver in the airport to find the lost item, which made the search fast and easy.

While I was in the airport picking up a lost baby stroller, my wife and her family went up to the roof top for a place to eat, since we were very hungry after the flight. However, the restaurants upstairs were fully booked and the only option was to go outside of the hotel for a lunch. Then I sent WhatsApp message to Mark and his team asking if they could arrange for us a table, and to our surprise they found one table for us. This type of treatment made us feel like we are the special guests of the hotel, but we were just an ordinary family staying for few nights in the Delux rooms.

The team was always online available to answer all our questions, arranging bookings for us and etc.

Eventually the experience we had with the hotel service makes us want to come back to this hotel, and I can definitely tell, that because of Mark and his team we are going to come back for our next trip to Singapore to this place, just to feel a little bit special.

In this hotel, thanks to Mark and his team, you do get treated personally and respectfully.

Me and my family we are very thankful to Mark and his team to make our trip to Singapore memorial and hassle free.

Will surely recommend this place to my friends and family when going to Singapore.

This hotel is a must stay to experience this private hospitality.

Dmitrii & his family with love.",Date of stay:
Prepare to be wowed,"Amazing from the moment we were greeted out of the shuttle. Greeted by name and taken to priority booking room as we had booked with amex. We were personally shown to our room with fab views of the city. Lots of personal touches and extras such as macrons and models. Lovely view of light show from our room. My hubby shut my daughters fingers in a car door and the staff had a medical team there within 20 seconds. Couldn’t fault any of the service especially as they were servicing up to 6000 people at a time. Only down side was that as we travelled as a family, it is t really as suited as a family friendly destination, more slightly older. There were food options but had just been better at other places. Still that’s not their main focus and we appreciate that. Also to be mentioned is how close it is to everything especially gardens by the bay. Def worth a visit.",Date of stay:
Still in awe from the amazing experience (Thanks NICOLE!!),"Travelled to visit Marina Bay Sands from the United States on Dec 28th, 2022.

On December 22nd, 2022, I contacted Marina Bay Sands hoping to plan surprise proposal to my girlfriend on the Sky Observatory deck. No other piece of modern architecture is more iconic than MBS in Southeast Asia and I had my eyes set.

In just the few days before the Christmas holiday, Nicole was offered to connect with my 3rd party photographer and help coordinate the proposal as if I asked my best friend one favor in my lifetime. She is an amazing human and I can tell why MBS is lucky to have her be the face of their iconic brand.

Nicole granted permission for my photographer to be at the Sky Observatory Deck for the special moment when I popped the question. She even kept in communication with my photographer on a 2 hour photoshoot to surprise us with a generous gift with chilled champagne and truffle chocolates in our room when we returned.

The property itself is fantastic - from the intimate infinity pools, to the world-class architecture in the casino, to the immense amount of beautiful shops in the mall. Oh, and we cannot forget the delicious food at the food courts.

The experience at the property was far superior than the hundreds (yes hundreds) of times that I've visited in Las Vegas. But, it was truly the delicately care that Nicole selflessly provided that truly meant more than anything.",Date of stay:

Fantastic experience,"Great experience - brilliant Premium Service team with Suzana and Mark going above and beyond to make sure that we were comfortable, happy and enjoyed our stay.

Wow!,"Having had 3 nights at the Paradox at Clark Quay we had a final night at MBS . It was our anniversary a few days before and so emailed the hotel to enquire if anything special could be done . This hotel and the staff go over and beyond what is expected . Not only did they email back to advise they would provide a desert and try and accommodate a higher floor but when we checked in the lady on reception also gave us 50 S dollars to use whilst in Hotel .
Floor 10 in Tower 3 was a great view over Bay gardens . A delicious desert awaited us . Water and fruit juice complimentary. The room was fab . Great 5 star . Large TV , comfortable bed , large shower and great toiletries.
Fortunately the sun shone so up to the iconic pool which didn’t disappoint and was on my bucket list . Wow !!
I loved this hotel . Not for everyone. Lots of designer shops and a casino . Watched the light show , sky observations deck great for views . Staff so friendly and organised . Probably won’t return as there are so many other places in the world I need to see but Singapore was great .",Date of stay:
Better to look at than stay in.,"We stayed for 2 nights in January, immediately after Luna new year, so the hotel was fully booked. The hotel is luxurious but with over 2,500 full rooms, it was very crowded. The service was efficient but impersonal. Our room was on the 48th floor, very well appointed with a fantastic view of Singapore however, it stank of stale cigarette smoke. Every time you entered the room, you would be hit with the foul stale smell. Our teenage son had to sleep on a pull out sofa bed (not that that is an issue) which was extremely uncomfortable and you could feel the springs in the mattress. You would expect better from a 5 star hotel for additional sleeping requirements.

The fitness centre is very well equipped, has a great view and includes sauna & steam rooms. The famous rooftop infinity pool was spectacular but the days we were there it was raining and windy so we only used it to take a few photos.

The location is really good and the adjoining shopping mall, casino, theatre, food courts are only a short walk away. The choice of high quality food/eating options within the hotel is very impressive. We had the Luna buffet and was impressed with the range and quality of food available. Good quality seafood including lobsters, Alaskan crab, scallops and much more was in abundance.

Overall the stay was nice but the room smell and lack of personalised service detracted from the experience.",Date of stay:
An amazing experience,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and had such an incredible experience. The hotel is stunning, so much thought has gone into designing it.
But the element that made this hotel truly wonderful was the staff. Mark from premium hotel services went above a beyond for us and when we left he sent a personalised card to say goodbye and we were in complete shock. This is next level customer service!

Great service and amazing view,"The staff are friendly. One concierge staff helped us to pay for the taxi because we didn't have enough cash then.The services at the gym and spa were great. The infinity pool has a stunning view of the Singapore's business hub while our room has an amazing view of the marina area and Garden by the Bay. Free access to the Skydeck is also a big plus. The location is great. Everything is at arm's length (shopping center, restaurants, casino, Chinatown, etc). Hassle free check-in and out. We were allowed to use the pool longer than our check-out time. The only disadvantage I could say is that the in-house restaurants (especially by the pool) have long waiting time. But maybe because it was popular and the food was delicious",Date of stay:
One of the best and my favourite hotel in Singapore to stay.,"Always a pleasure to stay at this hotel, and this is I think the 10th or 11th time I've stayed at this MBS hotel and it's always been a pleasure. The rooms are huge, bay view, city view, garden bay view, whatever you fancy.
Marina Bay Sands Hotel is one of the best luxury hotels in Singapore which is just a few steps away from the best Shopping Mall, Casino, Spa, Gym and many restaurants and valet service. It is perfect for a staycation, business trip or vacation to stay over.

Wonderful stay at Marina Bay Sands,"From the moment we arrived till the drop off at the airport on our departure everyone was genuinely so friendly and helpful and went above and beyond which made us feel really special.

The level of service was of the highest standard and we truly felt welcomed and appreciated as guests of the hotel. We cannot recommend the Marina Bay Sands enough and thoroughly look forward to the next time we get a chance to travel to Singapore and stay there again.

Thank you and the rest of the Premier Services team and all of the other staff at the Marina Bay Sands.

Excellent service but average rooms,"We stayed at the Sands for a couple of nights on our recent visit because we wanted to cross it off the bucket list. The service and check in was excellent, we received our room hours before the official check in time. However, our room was on a lower floor and the noise from the freeway beside the hotel was horrendous. For the price it’s simply not worth it.",Date of stay:
Unforgettable MBS!,"My husband and I spent our anniversary at MBS for one night whilst visiting Singapore. Our room was Harbour View on 40th floor with amazing views of harbour and Gardens by the Bay (we got to see the light show from above!). Room was a good size and bathroom great. TV was enormous!

Highlights:
- extra care and detail for our anniversary was beautiful - cake, wine, flowers. Thank you Rosie :)
- rooftop pool is AMAZING - we went at about 6pm and stayed for sunset, then again in the morning. Both times we got lounge chairs easily. I have never experienced anything like this pool. Definitely worth the $$$ for us.
- LAVO for dinner (Tower 1) was great. Recommend booking early and ordering the peanut butter chocolate layer cake (can get it to take away)
- breakfast at Spago was good - normal buffet, but with a beautiful view

Honestly a fantastic experience for us.",Date of stay:
Pricey but worthwhile stay in a global landmark,"I stayed here in room 4011 (a king bed with a garden view) in Tower 3 for two nights in January 2023.

Rating: 8/10

Positives:
• The view and balcony from the 40th floor over the Marina Bay gardens was eye-watering
• Bathing in the infinity pool on the top floor was a once-in-a-lifetime experience (although the water was a bit chilly)
• The service was excellent although the personality of the hotel seemed to be lost amidst all of the other shops, restaurants, and amenities that shared the facility
• The gym at the top of Tower 2 was outstanding and allowed me to work out facing 50th+ floor views over downtown Singapore
• I didn't visit the casino but it was incredibly convenient to be connected to a mall with wonderful shopping and dining options
• The hotel featured a novel express check-out system

Negatives:
• The Marina Bay Sands is a bit of a trek from some of the other activities of Singapore, such as Orchard Road, albeit a trek that is still doable or easily arranged via taxi or public transport
• The bed was a bit hard
• The room itself was clean and modern but nothing extraordinary and was perhaps just starting to show its age
• The rooftop bar on the top of Tower 3 seemed poorly managed – in what appeared close to full occupancy it took 20+ minutes between ordering a drink at the bar and having it served and paid for (I wanted to walk around and enjoy the view drink-in-hand)",Date of stay:
Stunning and busy,"We had a good visit here - just the restaurants, but it was impressive with a fabulous vibe. Really so cool and great photo ops!

"Expensive, but what an experience","Wow!

Huge hotel that really hits the senses when you first arrive. We had a room overlooking the Gardens by the bay on the 20th floor.

Room was superb. Totally blown away when we opened the door and the curtains parted to an awesome view. Even the TV welcomed us.

Rest of the hotel was superb with a visit to the famous swimming pool on the roof and a cheeky cocktail as the sun went down ( very very busy, but still awesome) to the little shops in the concourse on the ground floor, and even getting down towards the MRT where there is even a replica of a Viennese canal complete with barges.

Staff were superb from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, considering they were very busy with hundreds of customers and visitors.

For us, it was only one night, and a bit of an expensive splurge on our trip, but we had to do it just to say we did.",Date of stay:
Stay Here at Least Once,"Marina Bay Sands (which everyone in Singapore calls MBS) is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Certainly one of the most iconic hotels in the world. The major claim to fame are its three towers capped by a rooftop infinity pool, restaurant and hot tubs.

The inside reminded us of Las Vegas premiere lobbies without all the slot machines and noise. The breakfast buffet was really more of a brunch spread with just about everything you could think of. Certainly one of the best I have ever seen.

The room was pretty nice and we arranged for three guests which included a rollaway. Since a fourth family member was joining us for the last night of our stay, we needed a second room. But in reality, there was a chaise lounge which could have easily accommodated our fourth…but second room was already paid for. Would have been nice for hotel to allow.

Can’t say enough about front desk service. In addition to allowing us to check in early after a 30 hour trip, the most amazing part was they remembered us BY NAME when we checked out five days later. And we’re really not that memorable.

The nearby casino can be reached via underground mall. The negative is you need to bring your passport to enter and stand in queues to get it scanned. My understanding is they are ok for foreigners to gamble, but make it hard/expensive for Singaporeans to do so.

To sum it up - stay here at least once. It will be a highlight of any Southeast Asia trip.",Date of stay:
Best hotel in Singapore,"The best hotel in Singapore !! We loved everything about it (especially the rooftop pool). Definitely worth it. We also loved the direct access to the mall and gardens by the bay. The room is spacious, the staff is professional and the food is delicious.",Date of stay:
Amazing Stay!,"MBS is THE place to stay if you are visiting Singapore for the first time. The service is exemplary! The lobby is huge and always kept clean and spotless. We arrived very early and the front desk agent who checked us in was very pleasant and courteous. Our check-in experience was very seamless.

We stayed in room 4001 (tower 3, floor 40) and had an AMAZING city view, at night you can see the skyline light up at night and you can get a good view of the water show every night. The room attendant who serviced our room was incredible. They were efficient and timely everyday, BIG thank you to the housekeeping staff for all that they do for a property this size.

The rooftop view and poor are amazing of course! The staff were courteous and patient. We had breakfast at Spago almost every morning and the staff were very friendly and welcomed us back every morning.

Our checkout experience was very seamless as well. We were assisted by Manu who was very friendly and kind. A perfect way to end our stay!

Again, I would highly recommend staying at MBS!",Date of stay:
Above and Beyond our expectation - the excellent services and experience,"Six nights at Marina Bay Sands {MBS} - the Team and staff, are what make our stay at the hotel memorable. Our Deluxe Room is spacious & daily housekeeping is great. The Infinity pool's view lives up to its reputation, but the staff at the pool, makes the experience even more memorable - just to name a couple: the lifeguard Ryan and MBS Ambassador Catherine. The Breakfast Buffet at the RISE Restaurant - Incredible, with lots of varieties, and choices, to meet the taste of all Travelers from around the world. From the restaurant maitre d', Paula, to waiters like Christian, managers like Amo & Raja, AND all the chefs' team at each of the buffet stations, they work hard to make sure the customers are happy with their experience at the RISE restaurant. Concierge Desk is fully staffed in order to meet the needs of the Travelers who stay at MBS and they are very helpful in providing precise information for Travelers, like us, in order to make their visit to Singapore even more memorable.",Date of stay:
Come for the pool but stay for the excellent service,"Marina Bay Sands is a hotel that needs no introduction. Many stay for the pool alone and frankly that is a perfect reason to stay here. People often ask if the pool is as nice as it looks...and yes, it is. It is indeed a reason enough to stay here. What really surprised me about MBS though is the service. For such an enormous Vegas sizes property the service is fantastic. Everyone I interacted with across the entire hotel was lovely and happy to assist. Guest services and housekeeping was also excellent. Is it normally my kind of hotel, no..it vaguely looks like a bit like an airport terminal, albeit a very high end one. I'm not going to speak negatively of the hotel for that because it's a stylistic choice and doesn't reflect on the quality of the hotel in anyway, which is lovely. If you're coming to Singapore for the first time, or fifth, I can certainly recommend MBS as an icon and the excellent service is the cherry on top.",Date of stay:
Fantastic stay - incredible,"Spent a day here at the end of a cruise but could have spent a week! Amazing facility , super staff .

"Iconic hotel in a superb location, not worth the price tag sadly","My wife and I stayed here for my 35th Birthday. Being basically THE iconic landmark of Singapore, we had high expectations for the stay and ultimately were let down. Although the façade and much of the shopping/main MBS area exudes a 5-star resort feel, the actual rooms are extremely basic. Nothing about our stay was ""5-star"", for what the final bill was, I would expect a lot more in terms of room amenities, bed quality, overall service, resort perks, etc. Honestly at the end of the day, I just felt like another number in the que. The 57th floor pool is nice for the view only, after that wears off, there really is no substance at all. The menu you can order from is tiny (even though there are 3 restaurants up there, you can't order from them at the pool....what), the water is seriously frigid, and the drink menu is lacking. There is really no atmosphere at all up there either, from music to events, to theme, to....anything. You just look at the view and pay for overpriced drinks and food until you've had enough. The good thing is, there is plenty of options for F&B /shopping in the area, so no matter what you are looking for you are bound to find it, it is centrally located so you can get to anywhere you want to go from there.

Overall I would not recommend staying here, for what they charge and what you get, it really not worth it. There are several extremely nice hotels/stays in Singapore very much more worth you stay than here.",Date of stay:
Our Dream Anniversary,"After planning this trip for over 20 years, to finally make it happen was a dream come true for me and a dream vacation for my lovely wife. It was our 32nd anniversary holiday which we had planned for over a year. Right from the start, getting picked up at the airport (getting met at the gate lounge was a new first for us), our introduction to Marina Bay Sands by Nicholas Len and the staff was a huge level up for us. Our room overlooking the ocean was on the 47th floor and to say the views - both during the day and at night - where spectacular would be an understatement. The countless number of photos of the view we took during our stay will never get old.
Our dining experience that first night at Mr Puck's establishment in the mall was amazing. I had it on my list to enjoy a steak from Cut and neither of our meals disappointed. In fact, we had so much food (the breads and that awesome marbled butter ...) we had to admit defeat at take the remains of our meals back to the room. We tried both Rise and Spago for breakfast and while we enjoyed both, our favourite was definitely Rise with its many more options.
There was so much to see and do around the Marina Bay Sands complex that it took us over four days before we actually made it to some other parts of Singapore, so we will definitely be going back and this time we won't be lulled into staying the whole time by their wonderful roof top pool with endless views, or their countless eating establishments with endless varieties to suit every taste, or their multitude of shopping options, or their easy access to parks and walks around the bay ...

Once again, thank you very much Marina Bay Sands for making our dream trip a dream come true.",Date of stay:
An experience which worth to try it,"Sometime you are thinking a bout the life time experience . This is one of it. Leaving aside the size of the hotel, with 3 towers, you have a good connection the one of the largest malls in Singapore. Breakfast is perfect, internet is working fine. Quality of the sleep is perfect. Swimming pool is a life time experience.",Date of stay:
Tower 2 Floor 57 Bar,"We were going to go to the Sky Deck platform and at the last minute decided to see whether there was availability at the bar. Tower 1 info desk was heaving, so we walked further inside the hotel ground floor which is indeed impressive and found the Towet 2 lifts. We ascended to the 55th floor and then had to swap lifts for the final 2 floors and wow what a view. We came up by the infinity pool and whilst that was only available to residents the adjacent bar was open to everyone and they had sufficient tables to allow us to walk in without reservations. Initially they said we could only have the table for an hour. Actually, we spent a very pleasant couple of hours having fabulous cocktails. Not crazy expensive considering the location. Our waitress was lovely and so was her manager, who both were very attentive and gave us some free tester cocktails. If we had only had one cocktail it would have been very similar to the entry cost of the sky deck. Once the sun had set we walked across the bridge on the ground floor/1st floor to the Sky Gardens another wow from the ground. They have a shuttle bus for a couple of Bart that takes you around the Sky gardens. Very handy if you’ve walked too much. Should have got the train to China town but got a taxi outside the shopping mall over the road not realising that the taxi rank was so chaotic. Dinner at a busy Chinese restaurant full of locals was as good as we hoped it would be. The dried chicken with chilli is worth trying. The tables are quite close together and we ended up talking to one of the tables and trying each others dishes.",Date of stay:
Awesome! Must experience in Singapore,"ROOMS: very spacious and so bright, there is a nice balcony in every room. View on Gardens by the bay is excellent! But another side is also wonderful - you can see fountain show from your room. Every room os equipped with mini bar (water, soda) and fridge, bathrobes and slippers
LOCATION: you have direct access to the hotel’s lobby from the metro station, good location for walking around the Bay, 5min walking distance to Gardens by the Bay
FACILITIES: iconic infinity pool and sky deck, gym. There are plenty of restaurants, shops and services (ATM, grooming and etc), big deli grocery store and even casino
STAFF: so polite and friendly. When we were waiting for check-in, staff member provided us small bottles of water",Date of stay:
Well worth staying here!!,"We stayed here the first two nights of our trip and so glad we did. Our room was excellent 1315 - lots of storage, spacious, great balcony overlooking the gardens and clean. The bed wasn't as firm as we like but it was doable for a couple of nights. Access to infinity pool is well worth it and nice for relaxing/swimming/photos. Spago for breakfast is amazing, lots of choice with great service. Renko lounge is perfect for drinks before or after dinner as well as Lavo but the hostesses at Lavo are not that accommodating even when you have a reservation. Go to the bar instead if there is room. Ce La Vie was closed due to rain but even though it wasn't raining, it was closed with no explanation - Lavo is much better with the same views and much more welcoming. We will stay here again. Thank you for a great stay here.",Date of stay:

An incredible experience,"I had visualized the hotel long before I went to it in November 2022 for my 70th birthday, but the actual experience was fantastic. The infinity pool, the restaurants, the shops, the room and amenities were brilliant, but what made it unique was the personalized service. I had informed the hotel I was coming with friends and the management did everything to make the event very special, from being greeted at the airport and then in the lobby, to checking in being done in the room and the champagne and cakes waiting for me. An incredible experience for eight days. I could not have asked for anything better. Thank you Marina Bay Sands.",Date of stay:
Disappointed,"We visited Singapore to celebrate Christmas. We had stayed in MBS in 2015 and the experience was very good. So we decided to go there again. Unfortunately it was a bad decision. The hotel was overbooked and understaffed. An order of a cup of warm milk or a cup of chamomile tea took minimum 45 mins to 1 hr and many a times the kids went to bed without drinking that milk. The restaurants were perpetually booked for the entire day and so was the spa. For breakfast there was a huge queue and the waiting took away your appetite. The waitresses were overburdened and never remembered the orders that were placed with them. The hotel seemed to be biting more than it could chew. There give entry to random people in the lobby who come in only for selfies and gave the hotel the look of an overcrowded fish market. The infinity pool was the worst. The water was highly chlorinated and the snacks served there deserve zero stars. Roadside eateries serve better food.
MBS please upgrade your standard and increase your staff otherwise there is no dearth of good hotels in Singapore",Date of stay:

Avoid at all costs,"We moved from Ritz Carlton to Marina Bay Sands as kids wanted to experience the pool. What a big mistake! The rooms were half the size of what we had at the Ritz and we were paying more here. The service was terrible. We were told we would get a call or text when rooms are ready to checkin which we never got. So ended up waiting 2 hours just to check in. The restaurants were all fully booked for the entire duration of our stay. The place was so packed, like a shopping centre before Christmas. The only place for breakfast had queues so long that we ended up waiting 30 to 45 mins every morning just to be seated. We attended a Liverpool Crystal Palace match whilst we stayed there There were over many guests from the hotel who attended the match. When we got back (10 pm) we made a room service request for dinner and after 1 hour called them to chase. To be told there is another hour's wait. That meant waiting in excess of 2.5 hours for room service. We ended up cancelling it. The only saving grace is the pool. The staff and service there is great. But we could have had that without staying there. All other staff were arrogant and had an attitude. We would never stay there again. They allow non-residents to enter and the problem is there are people just walking around taking selfies. Even while having breakfast or lunch, and we found it so annoying. Not a good experience.",Date of stay:

For example, the room came with a Dyson hair dryer including a diffuser attachment - as a curly haired girl, this really impressed me. We had two small children and really appreciated the extra space too.",Date of stay:
Go for the pool!,The infinity pool is worth the price of admission. This place is great if you’ve been to Singapore and don’t need to run out and do touristy things. Stay here to purely stay in the hotel the whole time. There is enough to do and the pool offers great views.,Date of stay:

Just awesome!!!,"The service was absolute perfect. We got picked up directly at the plane. They helped us with our luggage and a very comfortable car brought us to the hotel.
Our suite was awesome! The room service was awesome!

Thanks for having us, we will come back!",Date of stay:
Processed rather than looked after.,"The main attraction is the pool, which does have amazing views. But as others have said on here, that’s about it. It is so big you are processed rather than looked after. It’s very expensive but others hotels have got customer service way way better. I’m pleased I stayed there for the experience but when we return to Singapore we’ll go somewhere that hasn’t forgotten how to look after it’s guests.",Date of stay:
Great service and room,Staycation at Marina Bay Sands for my husband birthday. We were so amazed to receive a bouquet of fruits a chocolate cake and a tray of chocolate with cutlery nicely done and delivered to our room. I love the room is so spacious and feel so cosy and we have a fantastic view from our room. We enjoyed our stay very much with great service and great room. I will be back.,Date of stay:
Shockingly bad,"Problem is this hotel is just so impersonal . Very expensive and cant deliver on service. The hotel basically cant cope at full capacity and deliver a quality personal experience. Great marketing when you get the customer to blame themselves for booking when the hotel is full and busy and getting them to admit its your fault for not booking when quieter. Try the in house app for room service. Unbelieveably clunky and hard to use. Then try ringing down and its worse......... I gave up and went to bed hungry.
Overpriced and getting away with it because they can!!!!!!!!
This is Butlins for millionaires (google it).
In the interests of balance.........Great location and views.Rooms reasonably well appointed but youre at the top end on price and the experience isnt matched by the price. Too big, too impersonal.....Sorry and i know management and staff didnt get out of bed to do a bad days work. Quality is awarded by the customer not claimed by the provider, End of school report.....MUST TRY HARDER. Absolutely crammed full which means its popular and people love it. Try it you might love it. But too many things not right for me. Cant please all of the people and Im one of them.",Date of stay:
Incredible experience.,"Incredible experience. To be honest I booked it for the infinity pool, as a treat. The hotel is a high-end, luxury destination but that top floor pool area, with palm trees and chill-out DJ tracks on a weekend, is spectacular. The adjoining mall, together with fountain show in the bay, is breathtakingly good. Can’t fault any aspect of this hotel from start to finish. Loved it.",Date of stay:

1st visit to Singapore,"Our 1st impression of Singapore outside of the airport was the staff at Marina Bay Sands resort. I can not say enough nice things about the people of this resort. From Mark at Premium Services to the housekeepers, the bellman, and Paula at the Rise Buffet. I could go on with the pool staff and more. Everyone was so helpful and truly wanting to make our stay exceptional. They succeeded. This resort is fantastic. Our very short stay was not long enough and I certainly hope we have the opportunity to come back and stay for several days.

Marina Bay Sands Orchid Suite Stay,"The service provided by MBS was anttentive and had enjoyed my 3 days and 2 night stay at the Orchid Suite at 54th floor at Tower 3. The view from ge suite was breathtaking. The chocolate cake that they prepared by premium service for my so. was delicious. The service staff were friendly and the amenities were replenished daily. The highlight of the stay was definitely the infinity pool and the management at the pool was attentive too. There was a free temporary tattoo art service crafted for all ages at the pool. I believe that this is a holiday event organised by MBS.
Would visit again because of the infinity pool and the places attraction around the vicinity.",Date of stay:

Service Falls below expectations,Came for a staycation for a family event. Check in queue was long and service was not up to expectations. Hotel seems to be overbooked and all our request was not granted. We have booked the hotel early in the year and it seems booking early doesn't make much of difference.,Date of stay:
The Best Customer Service,"I wish to congratulate MBS for recruiting the most genuine and sincere person I’ve ever met in the Hospitality line. It is my 5th stay with my friends at MBS. When we were attended by Daniel from Premium Service and to my surprise, he attended to me before at different hotel. He recognise me and had such genuine smile and welcomed my friends and I with such joy! Not just the greetings, he performed such high level of service that never fails to impress me. Never forget that he is still as thoughtful as he is in my previous encounter and pass my friends kid colouring book. It is such attention to little details that truly define “Customer Service”. I hope to see you again and you deserve your new career and position as premium services at MBS.",Date of stay:
Although room is pricy but worth for our visit in great hospitality services,"Warm welcoming by doormen under a rainy day. Happy face with right attitude.

A bit long queue for check in counter at tower 1&2. Email instructed to check in at tower 1 but was told our room category is located at tower 3. Have to walk over to the other end for our check in. Good to offer at city view even though at lower floor as requested.

Most impressive by your lovely housekeeping staff Gai Meng, who approached us this morning for room clean up with sincere personality and carrying a big smiling face even covered with mask. Great asset and would like to have extra compliments to her.

Hope we can meet her once again in next visit.

Thank you everyone!

MBS arranged to pick us up and take us to the hotel where we were immediately met by a representative who took us straight up to our room and checked us in there. Bottle of champagne, cake and flowers were in situ for Jayne which was really well received. The room was huge and all amenities were great. The club 55 was superb, staff so polite and helpful and overall the hotel, staff and service could not be improved upon. Limousine arranged complimentary to take us to our next accommodation and it was fantastic.We will be back again for hopefully another memorable visit. Thank you MBS and all staff.",Date of stay:
I am still dreaming about my time there,Wowsa. We stayed in a Sands Premier Room for 2 nights in Tower 2 with a magnificent view of the marina.

5 star for the masses,"Pure class, but a very big hotel and this can take a little of the shine off it. Only issue was housekeeping forgot to put towels in the room. I found out the hard way. And it's expensive, real expensive. But in saying this I'd definitely stay here again. It's a walk to the gardens and a quick. Taxi down town.
Cabs were hard to find so suggest getting a SIM card and using online rideshare.
Also pay for a city view.",Date of stay:

Wonderful experience at MBS Hotel,"Hi Team, I would like to show my upmost appreciation to Mr Andre, from Premium Service Team. I have wanted to compliment Andre’s professional service but have not been able to find the right channel to do so.

First of all, I would like to show my appreciation to Mr Andre for making our stay at MBS being so memorable and special for us. I do understand that we have made a request of extending our suite stay at the eleventh hour and thus we are not expecting too much from MBS. However, Mr Andre managed to bring us a very pleasant surprise of extending the suite stay for us, and what makes it so special is that we will be staying in the same suite. This has brought us huge convenience as we have a young toddler with us, and changing suite room means that we will need to spend the hassle to pack and unpack, not being able to enjoy the stay. Mr Andre has, of cos anticipated this while doing the planning for us. In addition, he also brought a sweet surprise to our toddler with a bunny. We can't thank him enough for this sweet gesture.

As mentioned, having such wonderful experience stay at MBS is also all thanks to the Premium service team for extending a $150 dining credits to us. Therefore, we have decided to have another stay in the coming year as we know that MBS is always fully booked till the end of the year! At the moment, we are touching base with Mr Andre on this, understanding rates and hopefully, we can have promotion or early bird discount.

I look forward to return back to MBS hotel for another wonderful stay with my family in soonest time.",Date of stay:

It certainly has the wow factor.",Date of stay:
Nice view but lack service,"The rooms is adequate with great view but the hotel food service is lacking. I stayed two nights at the hotel but had two terrible experiences at the top floor and Rise on the ground floor for breakfast. The service level is not really live up to a 5 stars hotel. They seems do not feel like to serve us. The Rise staff even came to tell us half way into our breakfast buffet that they will charge $20 for juices even though the BUFFET is included in the room. We ask for the manager for explanation but hear nothing. It was later on find out if you go ask for freshly squeezed juice then it will be charged. If you go for the juice at the buffet table then it is free. However the waitress made the mistake never came and apologize for the mistake. Her attitude was not good neither is her English. Other employee apologized to us for the mistake eventually after we complained but with two bad experience at two different restaurant make you winder...

My experience can be summarized as great view but service is inadequate.",Date of stay:

"Absolutely amazing, expensive but amazing","This hotel has been on my bucket list since watching a documentary pre covid-19.

It didn't disappoint and yes it is very expensive but for a 'Once in a lifetime' experience it's worth it.

We had a city view deluxe room on the 46th floor and it was very special, the views over the fountains and city were mesmerising, could spend hours in there watching the world go by.

The thing that makes this extra special is the infinity Pool on the 57th floor, WOW 👌 We visited every morning and evening for sunrise and sunset. As well as the infinity Pool there are hot tubs, loungers, couples seating and a couple of restaurants. Food and drink is also available, but be aware it is very expensive and you need to allow for taxes and 10% service charge go be added.

We were given a complimentary upgrade. Room has very large and comfortable bed, sofa, table and chairs and a non alcoholic mini bar which is complementary.

We could have stayed In the hotel and associated complex for our entire stay, 4 nights

Variety of places to eat ( and shop) from cheap food court to very expensive high class restaurants.

Staff were top class, nothing too much trouble and so attentive and friendly.",Date of stay:
Delightful service provided by the Premium Services team especially by Mr Nicholas Len.,"Was supposed to have a delightful and fuss free check in for the suite room but was not informed beforehand so went the usual route. However, the front desk informed Premium Services and Nicholas came by and quickly assisted my wife and family in the check-in which was greatly appreciated since there were elderly and kids in tow.

Hotel stay at MBS was already delightful from my past experiences and continued to be delightful in this trip but my first suite stay brought my expectation to new heights with the amenities of the suite, the wonderful service of the Club 55 staff and not forgetting Nicholas who went all out to made this stay an unforgettable experience with professionalism, thoughtful surprises after understanding the purpose of our trip, and even a nice gesture when we were checking out. Overall, the experience of the suite and Nicholas' delightful service completely wow-ed my family and I will definitely be back again. Highly recommended if fuss free and delightful experience is what one is looking for.

Facilities-wise, the view from the room, the legendary infinity pool, and the gym continue to be excellent. There were daily kids activities which were good to keep the young energetic ones happy. Advice: plan and book the F&B outlets that you will want to go for the trip earlier to prevent disappointment.",Date of stay:

A big disappointment,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for one night in November 2022 it was something We always wanted to do, but was so disappointed
We booked and paid for a triple room as we were 3 adults At check in we were told that another bed would be allocated to the room and that would be taken care of
On inspecting the room the toilet area was dirty There were stains on the carpet Could see no quality control Had taken place on the room. We went out of the hotel to enjoy Singapore when we returned to the room in the evening no extra bed had been put in the room 2 of us had to share one bed which was not a comfortable nights sleep. breakfast was a real let down I think the hotel is just a show piece with no substance just over hyped And over priced for what we got On our trip we stayed in 5 other hotels and were all 5 star and they were so much better all the rooms accommodated 3 adults And clean we stayed at the Four Seasons in Singapore on our trip room fantastic food lovely and far cheaper should not have wasted our money at MBS",Date of stay:
A hotel with excellent facilities but disappointing services,"My friend and I were staying for 3 nights in this hotel to attend an activity nearby. At first we were fascinated by how modern and grand everything in this hotel looked, but its services later turned out to be a real nightmare.

The first night started with a disturbing sound from 2:30am for every 5-minute interval arising by the pressure from the pipe system. After 15-20 minutes we could not stand with the noise and decided to call for a check. A technician then came to our room, inspected and asked if we want a room change we should call the front desk on our own, so we explained everything to the reception, but we were offered a downgrade without any compensation or had to wait until the morning for their management team to get back to work. We turned down this unacceptable offer and asked them to reply as soon as possible BUT NOT UNTIL THE MORNING. Half an hour later we were given a same grade of room, with card keys delivered to our new room and our stay extended to 2pm on our last day. Why would such a 5-star hotel have no 24-hour management for emergency situations?

On the next day we were pleasantly surprised they delivered some great truffle chocolates and a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused. However on the last day, after we finished relaxing at the fascinating infinity pool on the top floor at 12pm, our card keys stopped working, and after lining up at the lobby with our swimwear to find out what happened, we figured out the card keys worked until 12pm but not 2 as promised. The reception lady named Adele claimed we should approach them for an extension. How in the world the customers will understand THE WAY YOUR SYSTEM WORKS?????? Why are not the card keys being delivered to our room???? Or a note saying our cards should be replaced????

By the time we checked in, we were told that the amounts we spent in Marina Bay Sands hotel mall could be accumulated as points, which can be used to reduce our room price when we check out. However by the checkout time, the same lady Adele decided to settle the payment as quick as she could without even bother asking whether we had any points available. It was not until we raised out how our points could be utilized, she then realized we had points to use. She even urged us to spend more on the hotel shops before even trying to void the invoice so that, we believe, she did not bear any responsibility for her mistakes. However we of course refused and eventually got our points deducted from the room price by her manager with the previous settlement voided.

We had to say the facilities in the hotels are awesome, including the gym, sauna, steam bath, restaurants, and especially the infinity pool. The rooms are flawlessly clean. However we were very disappointed with this terrible experience happening in a 5-star hotel as an icon of Singapore. The services seriously need great improvement.",Date of stay:

Dedicated and excellent service by the staff at MBS has made us feel important as guests with them. We had a little kid with us for the stay, the staff made sure that the amenities and facilities are well sorted and kids friendly.
Special mention to Ms Nicole Lee who has been managing our booking for the past few years to ensure that we get the best experience.

Disappointing - lacks focus on the customer experience,"What a disappointment….my wife and I looked forward to returning to Singapore to stay at MBS for our wedding anniversary…..should have gone somewhere classier, like the Mandarin Oriental!
The floor we were in (46th Tower 3) smelt of heavily chlorinated water….but was not near the Spa or Pool; our room smelt of god knows what, but it hit you as soon as you walked in; the bed was rock hard and there were NO soft furnishings in the room…harsh and beige is the only way to describe it. To cap it all, the day before we left, we contacted “Guest Services” to ask if we could access the pool after check out as we had a late-night flight that evening to be told that we could ONLY use the pool before check out - but after, we could not. Really poor customer focus. This place could do with an exercise in “secret shopper” to stay and use facilities without staff knowing that a report will go to top management (if they care?). They have the patter….”Oh, we are so sorry…..” etc, but our experience was a poor one - I’d recommend going to a hotel that doesn’t rely on style over substance!",Date of stay:
Worth Every Penny for a Night Stay,This hotel is so iconic of Singapore. I know it costs a bit on the high side but it is worth every penny. The staff are super attentive and helpful and always go the extra mile. The views are absolutely gorgeous and breath taking. The pool is on a whole other level and you can spend hours there just snapping photos. I would 10 out of 10 recommend this hotel to others even considering the price as it is well worth the stay.,Date of stay:

My happy place,"We returned after covid to our favourite hotel, it is just the most spectacular place
We love it here. Your luggage is collected on arrival and delivered to your room. Check in was a little slow but they were very busy. The rooms are enormous, our first night was in 4862 which was an upgrade to club it had a stand alone bathtub which we didn’t have time to use, and the garden view is mesmerising in front of you. There is now a nightly light show there. The second night we were in room 1721 I had requested a lower floor as these have much larger balconies. The infinity is selfie heaven for photos and reserved only for hotel guests. The bar area was not very accommodating in our opinion, we were told they wanted the table back in an hr which could put people of, however we stayed around 2 hrs. Under the hotel there is a shopping centre, food court some very good restaurants we ate at the French bistro we were a walk in but it’s better to make a reservation as there so busy. There is also the MRT. We had breakfast in the lobby which was probably the most choice I’ve ever seen. We would love to return to this hotel yes it’s expensive but worth every penny.",Date of stay:

Amazing bucket list experience,"We stayed at the marina bay sands as a young couple for 1 night before we start our budget backpacking trip. The pool is sensational and well worth the stay if the weather is dry. We were a little disappointed that the pool had to be closed due to lightning warnings but understand that this is out of staff’s control. The room was also very nice, clean and luxurious. Jerry from reception checked us in early and was very professional and polite, as were all the staff we dealt with. We were also given complimentary cake for a birthday which was great. The only thing we felt was missing was breakfast not being included in the price.

Overall it was a fabulous stay and would recommend to anyone that can afford this luxury.",Date of stay:
Birthday celebration,"Spent an awesome birthday weekend at MBS.
My staycation started off being whisked away in their first-class service MPV to the hotel. Check-in was a breeze at reception and being escorted to the room by the Premium Service team made me feel very welcome. Their immaculate service to walk me thru my suite to ensure my needs and requests are satisfied.😘
Delightful surprises of champagne cake and canapés were sent to the room too!
The room is clean and huge with spectacular 360° view, especially of the vibrant cityview at night.

Renovated rooms are amazing,"I stayed at MBS pre-pandemic and was rather disappointed with the guest rooms, they were extremely basic, more 3 Star than 5 Star, not worth the money. Heading back to Singapore I stayed in one of their renovated rooms and I was truly amazed by the transformation. The renovated rooms are top luxury, lots of accessories, a mini bar out of this world, they can finally compete with the best of the best.",Date of stay:
"once in a lifetime, amazing customer service","This has been on our bucket list for a while. We treated ourselves to a night mainly to experience the pool. On arrival we were told we had been upgraded to two suites but in different towers. We explained we needed to be near our teenage children and then the amazing Sheila somehow gave us the upgrade of a lifetime to a 2 bed suite on the 54th floor. We were beyond thrilled and she was so lovely and excited for us! The room was breathtaking and the view incredible. Everything that you hear about the pool is true, it is unlike anything I've ever seen before and worth every penny. Unfortunately the water was cold following a huge storm but that's because we chose to swim late at night when it was quiet. Breakfast was vast with every option you could ever imagine eating and more. If I'm honest I'd say it was more quantity than quality and although we were welcomed by the maitre d' who was lovely and very friendly the waiting staff didn't come to us once so I don't think we even managed a cup of coffee. Still we could have pushed. Everything at this hotel is on a vast scale but it's absolutely worth going to see and experience. Even the gin trolley and pudding buffet in the evening were worthy of note, there's just so much to try!",Date of stay:
Nice hotel with excellent Customer Service. We will be back.,"I have been staying few 5* hotel before and this is the best customer service hotel l met. I booked a suit room for my son birthday. To my surprise, the hotel called me one day before and told me that they can arrange a complimentary pickup from my home to MBS. Although l didn't need pick up from my home, but they allowed me to use it from MBS to my home during checkout. The check in process was smooth & the room was big, clean with beautiful view. Hotel even gave my son a complimentary nice dark chocolate cake. I would like to thanks the hotel staff, Mark Delegero, Alan & the staff who sent us back to home. With their professional services, We really enjoyed our stay and don't feel like going out of the room. We would like to thanks Mark Dlegero, he is very professional and knowledgeable, he knew that we are 1st time staying in MBS, he extend his service to show us arround, accompanied us to our room, brief us what is provided in the room, where we can enjoyed our breakfast next day and he even bring us to club 55, swimming pool etc. Of course we will be back in our next staycation.",Date of stay:
Fantastic in every aspect!,"As most people know, this place is expensive, but it is worth its money. The atmosphere is fantastic, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Great care is taken over even the smallest items and that makes all the difference. Plenty of places to eat, a large shopping centre with all major luxury brands attached and of course the infinity pool on the rooftop are just out of this world. You can stay in this Hotel for a few days without ever leaving it once [as we did this time]. We are already planning our next stay.",Date of stay:
Exceptional!,"The staff were exceptional, the room tremendous and the pool beyond belief. Yes it's expensive, but it was worth it and I would highly recommend if you are able to. There was simply nothing like it. Our room looked over the gardens and it was sensational. To watch the city go from light to dark from the pool is incredible. stunning.",Date of stay:
Good Experience,"We enjoyed our stay here.
The rooms were spacious and very clean with fantastic views of the city skyline.
Food was of a high standard.
The pool is amazing although crowded.
Easy access to transport and restaurants.",Date of stay:
Incredible pool/view but area very commercial & expensive,"You must go to experience the most amazing pool & view . The pool/jacuzzi are clean and safe ; the views from the room and pool are incredible . I would however , only recommend one night here and stay in Sentosa if you have a family . It’s very commercial and all about the shops at the marina and incredibly expensive . English breakfast by the way impossible unless happy to pay ALOT

We were given chocolates in the room ; drinks by the pool which made for a lovely tough by the hotel - you also get free ice cream
The resturants on the roof look amazing with great music vibes but it was confusing whether we could take our son in or not so didn’t eat there.

It’s perfect for the gardens by the bay and fountain show which I recommend . Taxi access extremely easy and good way to get around . Mini bar with soft drinks in room free which is a nice touch

Overall a real experience and a must do but think 1 maybe 2 nights enough for us",Date of stay:
BEST hotel in Singapore!,"Had the best stay!!! Booked the newly renovated Sands Premiere Room. Way better than the other room types (deluxe and premiere) we have stayed in before. Highly recommended! Worth the upgrade - very premium and executive feel, well thought of design and kudos to MBS team for doing the room renos. I need not to say more about the location and pool. This is the best in SG!",Date of stay:
Loved my stay!!,"Had the most fun, relaxing and homey vacation here last September 24-25!! All staff are commendable and might I add very approachable and knowledgable!! Because of the vastness of the hotel, it’s not hard to get lost but AHHHH staff are all very accommodating and even with the language barrier, they would push their limits just to help!! I loved every second of my stay here.

Just to add, I really had an amazing stay and dine in experience at lavo with the help of Sir Dennis in the pool area. He went above and beyond call of duty just to answer and help me with all my queries. Plus, he’s a great conversation starter. I really loved how he made us feel special as if we’ve known each other for so long. I love it so much!!
Would def go back here because of the superb service!
Thank you so much again Sir Dennis!!!!",Date of stay:
A hotel with the best facilities and services,"I stayed at the hotel for the entire four-day trip with two children on my first visit to Singapore.

The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is locationally perfect and has the best views and services by traveling to the country.
The cleanliness and room service of the accommodation were also excellent, and breakfast was also diverse and delicious.

With this trip, I learned why I think of the hotel when I think of Singapore.

Each of the hotel staff was very kind,
In particular, I would like to express my gratitude to Mark, a hotel employee who responded with kindness from the arrival of the trip to the end.
Thank you for making this unforgettable trip:)

If I visit Singapore again, I will definitely stay at Marina Bay Sands Hotel again.",Date of stay:
Stay as long as possible,"We stayed a couple of nights at the end of our trip following a personal recommendation

Amazing hotel,"My family of 4 stayed at the beautiful MBS for 7 nights - our first overseas trip since the pandemic. We had two connecting deluxe rooms, king room for the adults and a twin room for the teens. We had uninterrupted views of the Gardens by the Bay in our balconies - spent a lot of time out there! The fridge and mini bar were well stocked with complimentary water, soft drinks, juices, chips and nuts (replenished daily). The beds and pillows were so soft and comfortable and we slept so well everyday. The bathrooms were spacious with tub and generous toiletries. Infinity pool is a once in a lifetime experience - we made sure to swim at least once during our stay in the morning, afternoon and evening so we could appreciate the lighting and experience the atmosphere and vibe each time of the day. Walk along either end of the pool to see great views of Singapore - truly breathtaking! The hotel is HUGE however everyone we encountered from the front office/concierge/bellhop staff to the housekeeping staff have been nothing short of lovely.

MBS is connected to the shoppes downstairs (for high end shopping) but for those who want to hit other areas, its a quick underground walk to the MRT station (get a metro card - just tap in and out, way easier! Can be purchased at any metro station -just head to the ticket window to buy and you can top it up at any MRT machine later on if required.) We went to Sentosa, Chinatown, Orchard Road even all the way the suburbs to go to the waterpark with no issues at all. One of the easiest metro systems we've been on and the trains come every few minutes (City Mapper app is your friend!)

We've been to Singapore a few times before but this trip was particularly memorable, no doubt hugely thanks to a beautiful stay at MBS!",Date of stay:
Most famous hotel but worth it?,5 star hotel. is it though? or is it 5 star just cus where it is. we had the city view while the room wasnt luxurious (hence the 4 stars) the view was. Room service food was ok. expensive and not worth it. Plenty of food elsewhere way cheaper.We got free access to the skydeck and the pool. its also connected to a huge luxurious shopping mall and the marina and the gardens by the bay which is worth the visit. there were so many people checking in and out that it doesnt give you warm feel like any other luxury hotel from the staff. its kind of like a circus. if i could only stat at 1 luxury hotel it would be the ritz carlton across the bay,Date of stay:
The marina bay experience,"We stayed in MBS for two nights while visiting Singapore for the first time.
Very impressive place with a slick operation to keep it all running. We arrive early and we’re given temporary cards to allow us access for the pool and amenities which was really good and we did end up having our room early which is always a plus. The staff member who checked us in was very thorough and really helpful.
We had a garden view room and it was the best choice for views and the rooms were a big size with a gigantic tv which is always a plus.

The casino is a vibe! Felt like vegas minus the bar as they didn’t seem to have one there.

Pool was an amazing experience both in the day and the night. Views at nights are fantastic.
The Ce La Vi bar is well done and always busy. We didn’t reserve but decided to pop in for a drink to enjoy the views and were happy to stand as we didn’t reserve. However, the staff were pretty rude and almost made us feel very unwelcome and unwanted which was not the best for us starting our night off. Take this situation / scenario away - this would 100% be a five star review.",Date of stay:
Amazing experience,"This place is incredible, you have everything in your room. The price is high but it worst. Food is nice, the amenities in the room are incredible. The view to the gardens was amazing [ floor 36] the pool also is a great way to relax.",Date of stay:
Not what I expected,"Very disappointed with the experience at the infinity pool, I was looking forward to a really luxurious experience after paying a huge amount of money for the room. Obviously if you book with your partner you will not be expected to be with two cards all the time for pool access and this was not required the day before by the pool staff. Reception didn't Inform us about each of us must be with the card in order to access to the pool. We spent all day enjoying the pool. There was no waitress offering drinks, no one collecting rubbish. To get access to the restroom you must bring your card with you if not you get bad treatment from the staff asking you why you didn't bring the key card with you. Following day I got a really bad welcoming by Rima. She didn't let us get access to the pool because we only had 1 card. Her rudeness did not impress me and that is not what you expect at a luxurious hotel. She didn't even call Reception to confirm our name. I have to go all the way back to the 34 floor to pick up my card and back to see her again and not offer any apologies or at least a friendly welcoming. Call centre at the hotel fabulous, very friendly. Disappointed with the buffet breakfast Rise. The sofitel in the city does it way better and cheaper and theor rooms are amazing. They dont even have cream for a black coffee, and wheb we asked theybsaid its milk or nothing. Very rude. If you want to pay nearly $1000 NZD for the pool and the amazing view. Then you definitely get that. As for the rest, not worth the money. Go to the sofitel in the city who do hospo so much better.",Date of stay:
One of the better hotels in singapore,"This is always one of the better hotels in singapore. Staff are friendly. Food choices are good. The staff are trained to be so polite and helpful. Good system for training them

Restaurant choices are awesome. Bread street, Yardbird, imperial, Koma(beautiful). Parking is a hassle though. Difficult to get a lot. Easier to cab over",Date of stay:
A once in a lifetime experience.,"You have to stay here once in your life, how else do you get to swim in probably the greatest infinity pool in the world. The hotel is slick, check in however is not, be prepared to queue for a while. The view from our bedroom on 48th floor, of the city, was amazing, breakfast in the Spago rooftop restaurant was superb. Please be aware that the hotel is noisy. As soon as you step out of your room canned music follows you everywhere and there are so many people. Finding somewhere to eat, without lengthy queuing is just about impossible so do plan ahead. Overall, I am glad we stayed here but I doubt we will be back, in our 60's we are just too old for this hotel.",Date of stay:
Icon of Singapore,"Notably Singapore’s most iconic luxury hotel. Many say that if you have not taken a picture of yourself at the Marina Bay Sands, you have not been to Singapore ! Guests will have entry to Observation Deck and guaranteed access to the Infinity Pool but during peak period, the infinity pool will be very crowded. Non-hotel guests will need to pay for a fee to go up.to the observatory but not the pool.

Located 56 storeys up, the SkyPark Observation Deck offers panoramic scenic views of Marina Bay and Singapore’s famous skyline. There is the Ce La Vi bar that serves nice cocktails & drinks but getting a seat with unblocked views requires reservation. The best time to go is before sunset so that you can enjoy both day & night view over a couple of drinks.

However, if you want to see the Marina Bay Sands building as part of the skyline, I recommend that you go to another tall building eg. CapitaSpring’s 51st floor. It is just like you shouldn’t go to the Empire State Building if you want to see it as part of the Manhattan skyline.

Besides the roof top, there is the Sands Expo & Convention Centre and high end shopping mall linked to the hotel.",Date of stay:
Choose tower 2 for smart hotel experience.,"Spent some days at Tower 1, in a room facing the Gardens by the Bay. Then back in Tower 2 for another couple of days in a room facing the Singapore River. Both were awesome. Tower 2 is a renovated and smart hotel with bedside lights switching on automatically when u wake up at night, and smart toilet that stop all manual flushing or lifting up of lids. Service staff is impeccable and friendly.",Date of stay:
Incredible stay for the start of our honeymoon,"We cose the Marina Bay Sands as our first stop of our two week honeymoon.
All I can say is that the experience was second to none.
A very smooth and fast check-in.
A small issue with our travel agent which somehow thought it was a good ideea to start our honeymoon in a room with two single beds was dealt with in a very professional manner by the nice ladies at the check-in desk.
We received a very nice room upgrade with both a city view and a garden view.

Breakfast has so many options for all tastes and cuisines.

Dinner at Spago (57th floor) was amazing.

Infinity pool at the 57th floor is a 5 star experience .

We are not people who like to gamble but the Casino experience is a must.

Could not think of a better place to start our honeymoon.",Date of stay:
Fantastic views and loved the room. Infinity pool takes the win!,Firstly I have stayed here a few times. The architecture is superb. We had a lovely gentleman check us in to our hotel. Bell boys were friendly and super fast with bringing our luggage up. The gym is 5 star and has everything you need. The infinity pool is prob the best swimming pool I have ever swam in. It is my go to hotel in Singapore. Husband and I enjoyed our night here stopping over before our flight to greece. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone just wanting to experience once in a lifetime!,Date of stay:
Amazing hotel with outstanding staff!,"We were a group of 13 (7 of those being children), traveling with 3 separate reservations. During check-in, Jenah was very accommodating! We wanted to have our rooms on the same floor if possible. She worked tirelessly to make this happen. She escorted us to the Lounge to wait while she worked through this process. Once our UPGRADED room was ready, she personally showed us to our floor, explaining everything about the hotel along the way. She went above and beyond. It was a memorable experience. Our stay at the Marina Bay Sands was fantastic and we will definitely be back!!",Date of stay:
"Beautiful views, amazing pool and very clean rooms!!","Beautiful hotel, super helpful staff, incredible food. Staying here was a highlight of our Singapore trip!

It’s so close to key attractions such as Gardens by the Bay too!!",Date of stay:
Amazing stay in an iconic hotel,Architectural magnificence. Amazing hotel with superb facilities with a rooftop infinity pool. Staff very happy and helpful. Rooms are spacious and well furnished. Towels and robes provided for the pool. No pre-reservation was necessary due to the time of the year we visited which was a bonus for us. Reception staff were amazing and arranged our room by midday which gave us chance to enjoy our one night stay. The views from the infinity pool was breathtaking with once in a lifetime experience.,Date of stay:
"Iconic, a must if the pennies permit but its impersonal","Staying here is an event in itself. The roof top pool is fabulous. If the budget allows its a must. However, it's sheer size makes a stay somewhat impersonal. It's like leaving your bedroom and walking into a mall. Saying that it is well placed, views excellent, transport links are ideal and never to be forgotten accommodation.",Date of stay:
Amazing Hotel,"We stayed for 4 nights for my 60th Birthday, and it was everything we wanted. Please bear with me as it is quite a long review.
We originally booked for 3 nights in a city view orchid suite, but Singapore airlines changed our flight to the day earlier, so we booked an extra night in a deluxe room. Before arrival we got an e-mail asking if we wanted a complimentary transfer from the airport, we of course said yes please. So, when we arrived, we were meet by the driver and escorted to a luxury vehicle for transfer.
Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by a representative and escorted to my room for check in, we had been upgraded to a deluxe room with a city view. The room was great and in itself would have perfectly fitted our needs, the view was spectacular, but we were only in it for one night.
The next day we transferred to the orchid suite, and this was beyond what we expected, the room was massive. You walked in and there was a sitting room with tv and dining table with drinks and snacks all included with the room, the view was of the gardens by the bay great. You then walked through and on the left was a big walk-in wardrobe with safe and plenty of hanging space, on the right was the bathroom the bath was again large it had double sinks a big walk-in shower and a toilet.
You then walked into the bedroom, well I say bedroom, but it also had a sitting area another tv a big comfortable bed a massive room.
The room was fantastic but is expensive I would say it is well worth it.
More about the hotel now, the rooftop pool is obviously the big draw and is one of kind and something you just have to do, we did day and night swims, and both were great the drinks are good, and you just have a great time, be prepared it does get busy.
The room also came with access to the club 55 lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and later on drinks and canapes all were of top quality and the view is brilliant.
If you want to book a restaurant, which it has a lot in the hotel and in the shopping centre across the road, do it before you arrive maybe by a couple of weeks, as they were all booked up and we couldn't get in.
The location is great in the bay and with the MRT in shopping centre, getting around is easy the shops in centre are all designer and are very expensive.
The only negative was on check out; we had a late flight to Perth so we thought we would be able to stay to use the Sands lounge for a couple of hours and maybe have a cup of tea and relax, but no we had to sit on some hard seats in the busy check in area, it just seemed that once they had your money they didn't care, a bit of shame.
I will wrap it up as I have gone on a bit.
All in all, a top-class hotel with great service I will use again if I go back to Singapore.",Date of stay:
Lives up to the reputation,"I was very fortunate as I booked MBS at a time when prices were lower than they are today. There was not as much tourism in Singapore then as there is now. Of course it was still fairly expensive but i Think it was worth it, at least for me. Now when you are staying at MBS of course the best part is the pool. The rooms are fine, I actually got an upgrade from a lower floor to a slightly higher floor facing the gardens by the bay, but presumably you could get a better room and a better view at a different hotel for the same price. But the pool is truly unique. You don't even have to be swimming in the pool to experience the view, and of course take lots of pictures, overlooking the SG downtown skyline. At present there are still not as many tourists as before the pandemic, so the pool was not super crowded. And i was lucky that when I was there it stopped raining after raining more or less continuously for a week. Though, at night there was some lightning and so there were times when you could not swim in the pool during the lightning warning. One more thing also is that the rooms facing the gardens, at least the lower ones, are near a busy road, so it can be somewhat noisy in the morning. But this is a minor issue given that there are few hotels around the world that can offer an infinity pool like MBS does, especially on a clear day when you can see all the way into Malaysia. The other facilities, like the gym, are also not bad, but the pool is the reason you would stay there, and this is what makes MBS unique.",Date of stay:

Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel, the check-in staff member was exceptional and went out of her way to make our stay feel special as we were celebrating birthdays. The pool and view were the draw card.

The pool is nice but hotel room and service is not that good as 5 stars hotel,"You can go there for casino and infinity pool, other then this it's not attractive at all.

The infinity pool is nice but you will not going there everyday, because it's too many people and not easy to get seat and clear picture.

The renovation of hotel room is old, I can't understand why they can refurbish it. And the worst is they have renovation work during midnight. I can clearly hear someone drilling the wall at 2am. I called the reception and they told me doesn't know where is having night work and can't stop them.
I can't believe this is happening in 5 stars hotel and I was paying SGP$600 to sleep at the working site lol

I got the video with me and clearly can hear the drilling works, I was try to show to their manager and I forgot to do that, if you want to go pls think about it.",Date of stay:

Fantastic Hotel - A Must Stay,"It was my first time to Singapore which was for the F1 and I am so glad I had the chance to stay at Marina Bay Sands. What an experience and what a hotel!! The service from check in all the way until check out was incredible. Spacious rooms, attentive staff, complimentary mini bar plus the famous infinity pool are a must for anyone looking to stay. The countless food options and top restaurants on site are fantastic for any foodie. Can’t wait to be back and will only stay at MBS!!",Date of stay:
Best View of Singapore,Marina Bay sands is a must visit place for anyone who would like to view Singapore from top.

The New Icon of Singapore,"One of the best hotels in Singapore, the garden view has an open balcony, and the city has the most spectacular view of the Marina Bay area, including the water laser show, Spectra.

The Garden view is to see the sunrise; the city view is to see the sunset. Booth ate a spectacular view.

During special occasions, taking a city view is a good choice.",Date of stay:
Excellent,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for three nights.

This hotel was excellent and as we loved the pool.

However, out of all the hotels I have stayed at, I would like to say a special Thank You to Marina Bay Sands.

On our holiday (we went to a few places), my 10 year old son became ill and became dehydrated. By the time we reached Marina Bay Sands, it was becoming obvious that he was not well.

I contacted the front desk and the staff organised an ambulance and a doctor to come to examine him. Marina Bay Sands security helped take my son in a wheelchair to the ambulance and assisted us with our passports and details we would need to take to the hospital. The staff at Marina Bay Sands simply went above and beyond. My son went onto make a very speedy recovery after going to A&E at the hospital.

Yes - I thought the room we had was excellent. The hotel was wonderful and such a good location.

Above all though I would like to say a heartfelt thanks to the staff who really did care about us in our hour of need. I would like to say heartfelt thank you for making us feel so special and taking care of my son while we visited Singapore.

Thank you.",Date of stay:
A Hotel that is heaven for Adults but not great for families/kids.,"We arrived in Singapore as a family. Beforehand, we arrived to 2 different hotels that were cheap and reliable. When we first arrived to Marina Bay Sands, we were stupefied to see how many adults were in the hotel. At that time, it was school holidays in most parts of the world. The check-in time was at 4:00pm as well. When we first arrived to our room, it was pretty standard for a $1000 SD per night hotel. Nevertheless, the facilities were superior for adults. Consequently, Marina Bay Sands is a great hotel for adults ONLY.",Date of stay:
Surprisingly personal service at this huge hotel,"It's an enormous, sprawling hotel, and the check-in experience was similar to checking-in at an airport - not ideal.

However, it was clear after a few encounters with the staff that despite the fact that we were 4 people of thousands of people passing through, that this hotel was special.

Each interaction with the superb staff felt personal and the staff were fully invested in us having a great time.

I'd single out the following staff for exceptional service:

Concierge (and Clef D'Or holder) - Muzaffar - he went the extra mile to help us book our night safari
Pool-side manager - Maurice (one of the nicest Aussie's I've met)
Pool life guard - Mo ( a one in a million character)",Date of stay:

Vegas at Singapore,"This was my 2nd time at MBS. I had a great stay. I would like to say that this time I experienced an even better service. The room service was very prompt. The waiting time for breakfast was much less. Also the breakfast selection was very nice.

The staff was very helpful as I had arrived early and the check-in executive gave me a temporary card to access the pool and the health club so I could relax and shower by the time my room was being readied up.

The views from the hotel is undoubtedly amazing.",Date of stay:
Different to all the Rest,"This hotel deserves 5 stars for its sheer size. Our visit was to the MBS was the most impersonal experience I have ever had at any hotel anywhere in the world. When you arrive you are simply one of thousands of other guest who are checking in and out of the hotel that day. The surprising thing is everything does seem to be well managed which is why the place deserves five stars.
It is another thing I have ticked off the bucket list, but as for returning, that wont be happening.",Date of stay:
Breathtaking hotel with friendly staff,"We had a wonderful stay at MBS. The staff were friendly and helpful and of course the rooms, the pool, the views are AMAZING!

Disneyland on heat !,"If you are looking for luxurious personal service, this hotel is not for you.
The swimming pool view is the highlight but it's not for swimming, it is for posing and taking pictures.
We hadn't booked anything because we didn't know we had to and we didn't find a restaurant to eat in before 9pm because everything is fully booked.
There doesn't seem to be anyone to help you navigate the madness of so many people so even though as a hotel guest spending a lot of money it doesn't feel like you are important to the hotel.
The guest room is a wonderful sanctuary. We had a high view across the gardens and bay which was wonderful but this was not enough to make me want to go back.",Date of stay:

Exceeded expectations,"We booked the Deluxe Garden View room but we were very kindly upgraded to a newly refurbished suite in the second tower. This room blew every other hotel suit out of the water. The suite came with spacious rooms, very modern technology and insane views from both the bedroom and living room. Staff were very friendly and attentive. Only thing I would say I wasn’t to keen on would be the breakfast buffet, considering it is very dear, but this could just be down to personal preference.",Date of stay:
Best night ever,"We stayed in the Orchard Suite city view on the 45th floor, the team at MBS helped organise a surprise proposal for my partner.

Would definitely return!",Date of stay:
Perfect night away,"We stayed here as a couple on a Saturday night for my partners 40th Birthday. We stayed on the 52nd floor which had amazing views of the Marina and Singapore skyline.

The infinity pool on the roof had breathtaking views and we went here several times during our short stay. During the daytime we were kept topped up with free ice creams and ordered cocktails from the bar menu. The jacuzzi was the perfect way to end the evening.

The room itself was very spacious with a walk in shower, a very large bed, 2 giant TVs and a lounge area.

We had a meal in the evening at the Spago dining room. The food was delicious and well presented. To have a meal and drinks with the view across Gardens by the Bay was very special and well worth it.

There are so many hotel options in Singapore, but we are glad we stayed here and will have fond memories of our trip.",Date of stay:
Incredible Structure and Location,"We stayed at MBS at the beginning and at the end of our SE Asia trip.

The beginning was fabulous as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and also had an upgrade to the MBS ""Prestige"" Rewards Program, so we were upgraded to a fabulous suite, with a view of both the bay and gardens. They also delivered a cute little cake. We had signed up for the Re-Imagine promo and received a free voucher for each night of stay for either breakfast, lunch, rooftop lounge, science museum, or infinity pool photos. The Rise Restaurant was excellent with an amazing array of choices.

MBS is an incredible structure, with the best location. We walked to the Gardens by the Bay twice. Of course, the infinity pool and Observation deck are a must do as well.

The MBS Rewards program gives cash back for hotel stays and purchases. That works well if you plan to come back to Singapore before a year is up. Since we did return to Singapore and MBS at the end of our trip, we used the reward cash from the first stay. However, we cannot use the reward cash from this last visit since they give you the rewards after check out. MBS should allow online purchases using rewards.

Our second stay at MBS was a bit disappointing, as they did not upgrade us even though we are return customers, still celebrating our anniversary, and I had the Prestige Reward card (which includes an upgrade), but the booking was under my husband's name, who didn't have the ""Prestige card"". They could have easily changed the booking to my name, but refused. They did give us a cute little cake again.

Overall, one must stay at MBS at least once to experience this amazing place.",Date of stay:
Appalling customer service.,I was on a trip to Bali and decided to stop over at Singapore for two nights which I booked via their website. I booked a superior room which was on the highest level as I wished to experience the beautiful views across the city and Of course the infinity pool. However when I arrived after my long flight I started to encounter issues. I was only allowed to book one night as there was an issue with my card. So I stayed the one night. I was told to check and book again in the morning for the second night. Which I did but my card got declined. So I then had to leave the hotel to stay at the airport. I then find out a few days later that my card has been charged for the second night. This hotel would not allow me to stay the second night and happily escorted me out but then charge a full nights stay to my card. Absolutely disgusting.

Unique experience,"We were receiving invitations to Marina Bay Sands for the last 7 years or more. Last summer we decided to visit Singapore and, stay in this hotel. All Bay, View, rooms were already booked, so we took Garden View room on the opposite, side of the tower No 3. This turned out to be the best choice. All rooms with Bay view have no opening windows nor the balconies, however the Garden View rooms are having this, advantage. You can slide yoyr glass open and, enjoy the view from your balcony including evening concerts in the gardens with illumination of the artificial forest. All services were perfect. Laundry exceptionally good. Rooftop swimming pool Cristal clean and staff serving free drinks. Dining at, Rise restaurant opulent and very well served. The only thing I can not recommend is a rooftop bistro restaurant with an artificial queue and uncomfortable coffe tables..
In general, great time as long as you are not shy of the crowds, at the reception and Shopees mall.",Date of stay:
Perfection!,"What can I say but PERFECTION in every way!
Everything was just perfect, the room, decor, cleanliness (spotless), customer service, food…ooo, and let’s not forget the infinity pool, amazing!
From the moment I walked in after 16hr flight from London, till the moment I check out, I can not fault anything. Thank you so much for making my first Singapore visit so memorable and such a pleasant experience! I will definitely come back!
Highly recommended!",Date of stay:
THE HOTEL IS MORE INTRESTED IN QAUNTITY RATHER THAN THE QUALITY,"The rooms were not ready - and this was at 4.30 pm,, 90 minutes past check in time, it was very busy, and looks so much like, the hotel is more interested in quantity rather than the quality or the guest. The room was dirty, with large staining on the bed, which we had to ask to be changed - no dressing gowns or slippers. We had young adults with us - who asked at the pool area, about the music venue, on this floor (of which we could have booked, but was told the night club might suit them better), so didnt book, when they went to the nightclub, it was shut - they went back to floor 57 (i think it was 57), to be told oh sorry - yes i gave you thee wrong info - but then wouldn't let them as it was full, and they didnt book - although advised not to. I brought this to the attention of the check out clerk - whos english was very very poor - in the end it became very embarrassing, with a que of people. the cost the hotel charges, is ridiculous for the standard we had - Yes it has a lovely infinity pool - but there are far better hotels in singapore to use.",Date of stay:

Almost perfect honeymoon trip,"This could be a long overdue review since we stayed at Marina Bay Sands Singapore last 31st of July which was our most awaited honeymoon destination. We booked for 3 nights stay to a premium room. Everything was planned perfectly until we arrived in the hotel. There was a flocked of people everywhere, we don’t have any idea what was going on upon entering the door. We approached a gentleman wearing a black suit that we wanted to checked in and we found out that we could not check in because the hotel was having a system down. My husband and I wanted to melt down coming from a long flight only to found out that we could not get our room upon arriving the hotel. It was around half past 3 o clock when we arrived. I have never seen a hotel so huge, so crowded, so chaotic and there were no seats available. They asked us to give our contact details and they will call us once the system is back. My husband and I decided to go out and relax somewhere nearby for dinner. But it was around 10pm when we came back to the hotel and nobody from the hotel contacted us. We approached the concierge and directed us to the reception lady LJ or RJ. We were so furious and totally devastated for our first day experience in the hotel but the receptionist has sincerely apologizing to us and we really felt her genuine demeanour. She was the only one who said sorry to us for what was going on at that time. Despite of the hoarse voice she has for maybe apologizing to everyone at that time, we can feel the heartfelt service to us. She made us feel special even more when we told her that we were there for our honeymoon. She was really great despite of that situation she was very calm, composed and exceptionally wonderful. She upgraded our room to a suite room which has a very stunning view of Singapore from daytime to night. She even offered us a $300 credit to the room for the experience recovery which was not really necessary but my husband say to just accept it anyway. It seems that our disappointment has slowly faded away for the great service that we experience in general. The pool and the view was amazing!!! it is a huge property and like a one stop shop destination that must go to. We love the food in Lavo and Spago though it was so so difficult to reserved for a seat, we managed to get a slot. The view on top was perfect for a couple. I still want to go back again despite the hiccups. Probably a different arrival experience, a better one without too much crowd but still an exceptional service from the staff. Thank you Singapore and MBS.",Date of stay:
"Our room was out of this world, the place to stay is Marina Bay!","I visited Marina Bay for 2 nights on our way to Bali. Lots to share to help everyone make their decision if this is the place to stay in Singapore (we believe it is.)

Food - visited Spago and Cest la vie bar. Be clear when you book Spago if you want the fine dining as we made this mistake and we couldn’t then get a reservation at the fine dining as it was fully booked and they have a strict dress code so my boyfriend in shorts and a shirt wouldn’t have been allowed in anyway. The food was okay but we didn’t get to experience the fine dining which I’m sure would be out of this world.
Pool - way more impressive by night than by day. I love that there are different chill spaces like day beds, cabanas, sun beds etc… and that the pool and jacuzzis are open until 11pm at night. The hotel also allows guests to wonder in their robes and slippers which is nice touch, it creates a relaxed vibe in what is a busy 5 star hotel with global recognition.
Room - we booked a room on the highest floors so we were 49 (57 is the pool and 55 is the gym and spa so we were pretty high.) Our room was HUGE, it had 2 x 75 inch TV’s, a super king bed, a sofa living area and a huge bathroom. As we’d paid for being on a high floor, we had an amazing view.
Overall - well worth it for a couple of nights, any longer than that would be too much in my opinion and it is very expensive.",Date of stay:
An average hotel,"Stayed here as it seems the right thing to do when in Singapore, we were underwhelmed and thought the hotel was over rated, had to book even to have a drink in a bar, Ce la Vie deposit and minimum spend was extortionate, room was ok brekkie average, hotel is to big and lacks the personal touch.",Date of stay:
Excellent service from Premium Services,"Our stay were well taken care by the outstanding Premium Services team. Special thanks to Shataz, Nicholas and Mac for the seamless check in and check out. They were patient and professional. They provided direct contact number so that our needs could be attended promptly and it definitely made our stay amazing and smooth! Definitely recommend to book your room/event at mbs with Premium Services. Thank you team!",Date of stay:
Amazing Infinity pool!,"We book Marina Bay Sands, due to the pool.... and it is indeed an amazing pool! We love it!
Besides that, staff was always friendly and efficient.
Room was perfectly clean and we loved the room balcony with an amazing view over the Gardens by the Bay,

The price for a night is very expensive and does not include breakfast.... we pay the pool.",Date of stay:
6 Star Experience!!,"Amazing hotel with 6 star service!! The staff were fantastic, they made our ""sisters get-away"" extra special with their warmth and professional hospitality. In particular, we would like to acknowledge Gai, Room Guest Services - KJ, Infinity Pool lifeguard - and Jessie, Reception check-in Services. They all went out of their way to provide us with exceptional service and made us feel very welcomed. Can't wait to go back!!",Date of stay:
Great stay,"I enjoyed our stay at Marina Bay Sands, our room was a Garden View which was excellent. We could watch the Supertree show from our balcony which was a really cool experience because you could see the whole thing, as opposed to when you're actually at the Supertree show you only get a partial view.
The staff were all very friendly and attentive, Nicholas who checked us in was excellent, he was so helpful and made sure we knew everything about the hotel that we needed to. Candy in the gift shop was also wonderful, so friendly and helpful.
The pool is an awesome experience, as it wasn't peak season we got to go a few times. They bring around complimentary ice-creams too so definitely keep an eye out for them.
You also get access to the SkyPark Observation deck. It can be a little clunky to get to as you have to go through the same elevator as the non-guests and its separate from the rest of the hotel but its a great inclusion you should definitely take advantage of.",Date of stay:
Great experience at MBS,"It is my 3rd time staying at Mbs, it is good to be back here. I would like to compliment a particular staff, lifeguard Ryan. He has gone extra mile by volunteering to help us take photos, mingling with guests and helping his colleagues. He is a gem.",Date of stay:
Premium Services is a game changer,"Customer service from premium Services was immaculate, I mean next level. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel was nice, views were fantastic but the hospitality did it for us. Would 100% recommend.",Date of stay:
Way Overpriced,"Way overpriced for what you get.
Don’t get me wrong the view of the pool was amazing but without that the hotel is nothing.
Was £1000 for one night, and not worth it. I had dirty bedding which had to be changed. We couldn’t get into any of the roof top bars which I think as we were a hotel guest for one night we should have been Abel to. That was very disappointing.
The room wasn’t wow, which for that amount of money was also very disappointing. We spent most of our time at the infinity sky pool which was amazing but the only amazing thing of our stay. Had this been half the price perhaps I would have been more wowed but it’s defo not worth the money of the stay!
I had paid half the price of this for hotels which have been outstanding.",Date of stay:
Very terrible experience,"4 hours for hotel to arrange a room despite check-in @3.45pm, followed by 2 different versions of why the lengthy wait occured.

Worst is the service recovery that we didnt request for by a person called Jeevan. We dont usually go to such lengths to post. But his story of an IT outage causing Phone service to jam was absurd.",Date of stay:
Linda at ORIGIN + BLOOM...,"Just want to take the time to recognize one of the nicest people on staff. Every morning we woke up at 5:50 am to have the pool all to ourselves. At 6:50 my companion would leave the pool and head down to the Cafe ORIGIN + BLOOM. The coffee is great. But without fail, my companion, Maria, would return with our coffee saying how nice Linda at the front counter was to her. This happened every morning. Linda remembered our orders and always had a warm smile. So yeah, the hotel is amazing but always remember, its the people working there that makes it so.",Date of stay:
Doesn’t live up to the hype,"Besides the view from higher floor there’s nothing special about the hotel.

The customer service is very poor, which will take you by surprise compared to other 5 star luxury hotels.

Check-in process is long and there isn’t proper sitting/waiting area. Staff aren’t the friendliest.

Also would like to add the hotel is super crowded partly due to connecting with the mall I suppose.

My overall experience wasn’t really great and that’s my personal experience but i am pretty sure for some guests it was memorable one.",Date of stay:
Once in a lifetime 🤗,"Our plane was delayed, so we arrived in the middle of the night, and we were only going to stay for one day 😕
Staff was really nice, and offered us a delayed check-out and extended access to the pool, so we were actually really happy about that - it was really kind.
Therefore, we ended up having a really nice stay at the impressive Marina Bay Sands.",Date of stay:
Very expensive to stay here - you don’t get the ambience that you expect,"We stayed at Marina Bay for 3 nights - 26/29 Aug Hotel is very busy - they have trouble coping with the number of guests - we had to wait 40 minutes to check in.
The hotel is very expensive - $8.00 for a coke - $18.00 for a Heineken - $55.00 each for breakfast - dinner buffet in excess of $100 each
We tried to book restaurants on the 57th floor - there are 4 - I think - every restaurant was booked out for dinner - for the next 3 nights of our stay
I think 1 restaurant offered a table at 10.00pm !!
I suggested to the hotel that guests paying nearly $900 a night - should be advised to book the restaurants in advance of their stay so they are not disappointed.
Prior to arrival - the hotel advised you need to book a time for the swimming pool each day - I though this unusual - and it did make me doubt how good our stay was going to be. On arrival - reception advised you don’t have to book a time !
The swimming pool on the 57th floor was the highlight - it is the main attraction at Marina Bay - it is magnificent - and a wonderful experience. But that is it - that is what you are paying nearly a $900 night for - remove the swimming pool and it’s just another overpriced high rise hotel with a view over Singapore.
Staff are excellent - cleaning of the rooms was very prompt - bathroom was a little larger than normal - bedroom had a HUGE TV - but otherwise a standard size room.
Hotel was far too busy with people everywhere - people queueing to have breakfast - certainly not the ambience I was paying for !

Both my wife and I were glad to leave the hotel and would never go back - it’s ok to pay more than normal when staying in a premium hotel - but it was excessive - and made us feel uncomfortable - like the hotel was gauging as much as they could while we were staying there.",Date of stay:
Great service and the infinity pool was worth it!,"The service at the hotel was great and attentive; I had a wonderful welcome gift from the hotel. However, at the price of almost $1000 dollars a night that should be pretty standard. The pool was wonderful to experience and it is great that there was no time limit. It was not crowded at all and enjoyed the pool as well as the hot tubs overlooking the ships. For me it was a must do for the pool but I don't think I would spend the money again since there wasn't much else to justify the high price tag. Great cleaning staff and front reception.",Date of stay:

Not all it’s cracked up to be!,"Obviously a very luxurious stay but feels more like a business resort than a hotel. We were a honeymoon couple but they weren’t bothered by that. We choose this hotel thinking it would be the best in Singapore but were left feeling a bit deflated. A lot more work is needed in making guests feel like they are in-fact staying in the best hotel in Singapore.
Disappointing to find we had to pay a $400 holding fee which was not advertised and some 17 days later, we are still awaiting this refund - I don’t understand how they are able to hold on to your money for that long after check out??",Date of stay:
Personalised service and exceptional amenities and food,"We were concerned about the scale of the hotel and the number of guests and how that might impact our stay, but from even before reaching the hotel, we were so wonderfully assisted by a personalized check in staff as part of premier check-in services that we didn't need to worry about a thing. The luggage magically came to the room and left the room without us needing to supervise, thanks to the very able luggage staff and the exceptional operational management. It is worth staying in the suites for this premiere experience. Each dining option offered by the hotel is just fabulous, with the stunning views from Club 55, the beautifully crafted cakes and savouries at Renku, and especially the widespread and delicious breakfast selections at Rise. The ease with which the scale of operation at breakfast at Rise is managed is just remarkable. The swimming pool experience was also memorable, and we managed to go at times when the crowds were a little less. The suite itself was beautifully appointed, with all necessities placed in the correct position. The views were stunning..we were lucky to get a corner room for an Orchid suite, which offered both city and garden views with sunset and sunrise views. The large windows with mechanised curtains truly elevate the experience. The bathroom and all its amenities, including the selection of toiletries, was extremely premiere. And it is extremely easy to access the towers, the mall, and the various dining places due to the logical layout of the whole complex. The only thing thing that needs a bit of improvement is the elevator waiting time when exiting the sky deck. Overall, amazing stay and we will come back.",Date of stay:
Last night in Singapore,"I have stayed here 3 times now loved the first 2 visits not so good this time.
The hotel is great lovely room and the pool is wonderful unfortunately you now have to book the pool our morning booking didn’t get to poolside but the man on duty kindly let us in.
Pool and sky bar are lovely but we were refused entry before leaving for the airport at 5pm were told all tables were booked in spite of it being empty. We were given a bar stool seat and the restaurant remained empty till we left.
We had booked a twin room but were given a double/king bed told we had an upgrade with club facilities yet couldn’t use a conference type of room for my daughter to use for some work she had to do.
Previously we had breakfast included the high tea and canapés from 5-7pm now this is only included with Suites.

You have to wait for everything. You have to pre-register what time you want to check in. You get a ticket and wait for your number to be called just to check in.
The pool is cool. But you get only 1.5h a day and you have to register what time you want to access 24h prior. And it’s nothing relaxing. Full of Instagrammers taking photos and the staffs are constantly asking your room numbers to ensure 1.5h limit.

Worth it? YES!!,"Great hotel and great experience. The staff are very friendly, the hotel and rooms are extremely clean and the views are panoramic. Overall, Marina Bay Sands is worth the price of staying there at least once. The infinity pool is almost always open (6am-11pm) and was not crowded at all. During our stay there, we went to the pool as many times as we could and easily found lounge chairs. My only complaint is that the pool is not heated so it can get cold especially in the mornings. The food at the restaurants and the food court was delicious. The hotel is walking distance from one of the hawker centers (Lau Pa Sat) passing the marina into downtown. The metro station and bus stops are right there so taking public transportation was not a problem. We did our own city tour using the MRT with the help of the Concierge who told us where to go, what sites to see, and where to eat. Overall, an excellent trip. Will definitely go back!",Date of stay:
We choose Marina Bay for the swimming pool and for the fact that the place is notorious but we enjoy the time we spent,The staff is very friendly.

Awesome View,"Service for check-in was quick. You will need to register before checking in so that you won't have to wait long. Sms will be sent informing you of your Queue number.

We stayed at L51 at Tower 3 with City View. The room is huge with two big tv screens. The view is awesome. In the front is the city view that overlooks the water and on the left is the Garden by the bay view. The infinity pool has great views too. A little crowded but we managed to take some great photos. They were short staff but service is still top notch. The night view is best with lights up from Garden of the Bay as well as the city view. There is no time limit to using the pool.",Date of stay:
Great views but....,"It seems to be a must do while in the city. Once you get to the top there are great views but like everything else in Singapore (apart from the trains) it is expensive to eat/drink there.
As a visitor you need to pay to get to the top platform but are restricted in the areas you can go to unless you are a resident - as in you cannot go to the infinity pool. Cost per person is $22SGD/£13/16USD as of February 2020.
The views of the city and shoreline are great, it overlooks the F1 circuit and I would consider it a must do on a visit. If you can afford to stay there you will get much more however as a tourist it should be on your Singapore bucket list. It is also great to wander around the ground and mall on ground level.",Date of stay:

Outstanding view and atmosphere,"Booked a table to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. Breath taking views and restaurant.

Great stay,"There was a system glitch at the time of check in and hotel staff was struggling to let guests check in on time at 3 pm. Most of the guests had to stay in the lobby lounge area even after 5 pm and it wasn’t the experience expected after paying $800++ per room per night.
However, the reception staff Alice was genuinely concerned about us as we just arrived following a long flight and she noted it was my birthday, she ensured escalating the matter to her manager Lydia who took care of us very well. Both of them ensured that we were taken care of as best as possible while trying to resolve the check in issue beyond their control.

Thanks to both of them they turned a very stressful check in to a win by their service and ensured that we had an excellent stay in Marina bay sands.",Date of stay:
Moe the ICON of MBS 🤩,"I travelled with my best friend to Singapore in July for a week and we decided to spoil ourselves and stay at the beautiful Marina Bay Sands hotel. On the 57th floor was the ICONIC infinity pool that had the most amazing views.
During our stay we met the very entertaining lifeguard Moe. He honestly made our stay so much fun. Moe was there every day to greet us with a smile and fluff our sun bed pillows 😂
We would joke and livestream so all our family and friends would join in the fun and Moe became the face of our social media lives and so he got the name ICON MOE of MBS 🤩
If you are looking for a great time away with 10 ⭐️ service Moe will give you a fun holiday to remember. All our family and friends can’t wait to meet Moe 😍",Date of stay:
What a stunner,"Wow what an amazing experience. We had booked an orchard suite for 1 night and the hotel went over and above our expectations. Right from check in where we were met by Jasmine and taken to the lounge to check in we knew this was going to be a great time.

We were early so took a look around the shoppes shopping mall and was then called when our room was ready. Our main contact Mac took us to the room and we were blown away by the views and standard of the room.

We then visited the infinity pool which was incredible.

We then decided to book another night at MBS, due to the upcoming national holiday the suite was not available but Mac sorted it so we had a premium room and he arranged for all of our luggage to be transferred while we visited gardens by the bay.
He took us to our new room and had arranged gifts for us and our children.

The hotel is super clean and the TV’s are massive in the rooms.

We would come back again next time we are in Singapore.",Date of stay:

Marina Bay Sands,"The infinity pool is awesome. I recommend the first time to visit the pool at dark, it is just amazing. At sunset is very crowded and in my opinion it is even more impressive in the dark and there is not much going on. From the rooms I was unfortunately a little disappointed, you pay the high price only for the pool, the rest of the hotel is below the renowned 5 star competition.
The associated shopping center is also spectacular and one of the largest I have ever seen. Small travel hack in the in-house casino you get drinks, cigarettes and more for free.",Date of stay:
Best time at this hotel! Pool was the highlight of trip!,"Staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore was amazing! I must say the pool was without a doubt the highlight for my family. Not only was the view breathtaking and service great but Moe ,one of the lifeguards ,made it one of the most memorable stays I think we’ll ever have. He instantly made sure we had everything we needed, helped take pictures of us and was so helpful in giving us information about the area.

Room service took too long but can understand the lack of staff after Covid hit this sector so hard. The view is of course outstanding but we also got in touch with Mr Moe Lamit working at the infinity pool. He was so friendly, offered to make pictures of us and shared insider ideas abt Singapore. We even stayed in contact after our visit and this made the stay at MBS even more special. Thanks for the unforgettable stay",Date of stay:
Best pool in the world!,"We stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon. The view from the room was amazing - and even more breathtaking from the infinity pool!

I recommend that you book your restaurants well in advance of your vacation. Sadly most of the restaurants at the hotel were fully booked for the duration of our stay, which didn’t leave many options for us. Room service took a very long time, which is understandable given the size of the hotel. We appreciated the chocolates offered to us by the hotel, as a gift for our honeymoon.

We were very impressed with the housekeeping staff who did an amazing job.

The hotel is in walking distance of the Gardens on the Bay, which is a great activity for tourists.

A Singapore Classic,"The Marina Bay Sands is a great hotel but its beigeness is starting to look a little dated. The views are outstanding and the location is very impressive. Tonnes of overpriced designer stores, and a relatively close food court and other good eating options nearby, seemingly for the Mainland Chinese visitors, good access for MRT and Taxis are almost non stop.

The rooms were large and very comfortable, we all loved the automatic curtains and the large bathrooms.

The Gardens by the bay are a great experience with the shuttle if the idea of a walk in 28c doesn't appeal to you. The nearby Art and Science museum was an unexpectedly fun trip and worth the visit if you have kids or a curious nature.

Its so large its almost tiring to walk around and the lifts make it a bit complex to reach the pool, but its well worth it for the experience and the occasional free ice creams and drinks. The gym needs a bit of updating, some of the equipment is getting a tiny bit tired.

Its a fabulous structure in a fabulous location. Everything works, albeit things like room service were unforgivably slow, $17 for a couple of slices of toast which takes 50 minutes to arrive is really not good enough. The room service food selection overall is large but a bit basic, and could do with an overhaul.

The Check-in process needs much less process. They are far too keen to get you in a queue and it would be much faster to just provide faster simpler service. An awful lot of looking and typing and looking and typing and confirming things in frankly pretty bad English is what I would expect from a regular 4 star. Even check out was a long and unnecessarily drawn out affair compared to other Singapore hotels. I think a robot check-in and out would be an attractive alternative option.

All in all its a fabulous hotel that has a good 12 years of service and is undergoing a refurb at the moment and if they get it right it will be a great hotel for the next decade too.",Date of stay:
Great but….,"I’m staying at the hotel at the moment and I wanted to give my initial impressions. The check-in process as well as booking to use the infinity pool are a bit quirky. Both require registration within 24 hours of arrival but the system was down when I tried and the backup mobile number also did not work. Slightly unusually, the reservations team does not seem to be as accessible as in other hotels (a bit slow). Prior to arrival, you are certainly left feeling that you have booked at a five-star hotel, but you are not being treated as an essential customer.

Upon arrival, we had a short wait during our registered check-in period but once all the paperwork had been completed (took longer than checking in at other hotels) we were left to our room and started enjoying the premises.

Wow.

This is a one-of-a-kind property and the views from the room (we booked two deluxe sky view rooms) are amazing. This is definitely a hotel that you want to stay in at least once if you are visiting Singapore. The children have really enjoyed the experience so far and we can see that the hotel is going to be an excellent base for exploring the various attractions.

We feel very safe (coming from Dubai) with the hygiene and Covid protocols here. There is still a requirement to wear masks (like Dubai) indoors and it feels safe to us having that although I appreciate that it’s relaxed more in other parts of the world.

We had our first breakfast at RISE this morning. The buffet was pretty good. However, as guests from the Middle East we did observe that there is a lack of understanding on our questions around halal food. Most five star restaurants at least understand the question and are able to reply with a yes or no.

We have a booking today at the infinity pool so we are excited to check that out. Look out for my next post as we work through our stay here!",Date of stay:
Infinity Pool,"The infinity pool on the roof of Marina Bay Sands makes it worth staying at this hotel alone. Despite the jaw dropping skyline views and the delicious food an drink options, one thing that made this trip memorable was a life guard named Moe. Upon attempting to take poor angled selfies with the gorgeous views, Moe charismatically offered his services to snap some photos of my girlfriend and I while catching all the perfect angles. I highly recommend this hotel, pool, and saying hello to my good friend Moe.",Date of stay:
Faultless!,"I felt really special the second I arrived. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and I felt really welcomed.
I was lucky enough to get my room upgraded and the view blew me away!
The infinity pool is absolutely beautiful and the perfect place to unwind.

Special mention to Fir who was one of the pool staff - I was travelling solo and he helped me out getting some amazing photos in the pool with that incredible view.

Would stay again in a heartbeat.",Date of stay:
Moe is the best,"It’s our first visit to Singapore. Did a fine choice of choosing MBS for our vacation. All was good from checking-in, room service & all service staff. But Moe from Infinity Pool has set a very high standard of an Exclusive Service which make MBS stand out. His goal of having in mind ‘making us a RETURN GUESTS’ is an asset to MBS. His recommendation of the facilities the hotel got to offer, the In-house celebrity restaurant help us a lot of make to do during our stay and where to dine. Moe… you are the BEST!",Date of stay:
Thank you Mr. Moe,Mr. Moe is absolutely a beautiful person inside and out. He welcomed us with open arms at MBS. His passion with customer service is definitely unmatched. Mr. Moe took his time to run a whole photo shoot for a group of 10 people 😳 He was patient and also helpful with posing tips. Thank you Mr. Moe for making our experience at MBS amazing 😊❤️,Date of stay:
Moe is the best,"I stayed at marina bay sand while I was visiting the pool, I met Moe the lifeguard and I asked him to take some pictures for me not only he was very pleasant and he also took the best pictures for my husband and I.

Not worth the money terribel honeymoon experience,"We stayed at the hotel for our honeymoon.
No service we couldn’t get a table for drinks even we stayed at a suite.
We asked to book a Michelin restaurant in advance bu no reply either at check-in or by mail.
Not a 5 star hotel sorry.
We have stayed at the best hotels around the world this isbod one of Them",Date of stay:
Awesome trip,"This is my first time when to Marina Bay Sands Singapore for my graduation trip  and it was such a wonderful experience. Moreover, on the infinity pool, I met Mr Moe that so friendly and helpful at the same time which mesmerize me that rare in nowadays hospitality landscape industry. He also knows the best angle photo spot, help take a picture. Once again me and my fam blessed to meet you,  hope can meet you again in the future Mr. Moe. Keep staying healthy and humble.",Date of stay:
Clearly impressive view & rooftop pool BUT besides that you will be treated like a mass tourist not 5* guest,"+ Amazing pool & rooftop view
+ even lowest price room really beautiful and amazing view
- Check in was a bit like ordering in MC Donalds and has nothing to do with a 5* hotel: harsh welcome in the lobby guiding us to the so called “VIP” check in, there you have to wait in a queue up and wait w/o seating option, we have been sitting with 2 kods on the stone stairs… (what we are used to in 5* hotels is being seated in a nice area, someone picking up the passports and checkin in for us while we enjoy our free welcome drinks)
- Service around the pool really poor: took us sometimes 15 min or more to get the attention of a waiter, food (burger & salad) took > 45mins and when we ordered extra mayonaose for the fries they dis not manage to brong before food was cold
- be aware that there is a strict checkout at 12 and you are not allowed to prolong or stay on the pool the day! Since there is also not really a lobby area where you could stay you cannot stay anywhere if your flight is later on the day and the hotel also does not care
- Breakfast was not close to what you would expect in a 5* hotel e.g.: no fresh juices available at the buffet (only for extra payment), some items are served in one-time plastic buckets same as you would have in a cheap fast food restaurant (e.g. pre-mixed Bircher Müsli, sauces)

To summarize: unfortunately you will only find this view/rooftop pool on this hotel, bit otherwise not really worth the price!",Date of stay:
Fun Holiday,Holidaying at Marina Bay Sands with our granddaughter was fun and relaxing. Nice room with majestic city view. Adjacent to Garden by the Bay and shopping mall. Friendly and courteous staffs. Thanks to Belle and Ryan being hispitable and helpfull. Breakfast was good and fresh and delicious. Swimming in the infinity pool at level 57 was an extra ordinary experience and fun especially for our ten years old granddaughter. Cheers.,Date of stay:
After hours (10pm) it dies a death,"First time here, blown away by what I saw, suppose the moon would be the same but after 10 mins you see it for what it is. Casino, nightmare to even enter and the staff are like tailors dummies, no personality or wit. Room service eh had to wait 30 mins for them to call me back...didn't so I kept calling back. Told me to order a Grab if I needed quick service.

Basically nice for one night then take a few months to get over the cash you gave them and hopefully after 10 years you only remember the good bit",Date of stay:
Vegas meets Disney,"Massive place crossed between Las Vegas and Disney, hard to get any personal service it’s crazy busy, the pool is stunning but manic and not relaxing at all it’s busy, noisy, all laid out in long lines with most people saving beds and not using them. Queues at every restaurant from early morning to late at night. It’s an exhausting experience. Concierge are so very helpful they really do make a difference. Rooms are pretty basic at most levels, views over bay are nice and interesting. Garden views are cool for the light show every night.",Date of stay:
What a fabulous place,"It’s big, it’s brash and it’s beautiful.

We stayed on the 51st floor for a couple of nights and the room and views were superb.

We didn’t use a huge amount of the hotel amenities but the infinity pool is spectacular and well worth staying at the hotel for.

Transfer from Changi is quick by taxi and pretty reasonably priced and would recommend as a low stress option.

The hotel isn’t cheap by any means but it’s quite an experience, certainly one we won’t forget.",Date of stay:
MBS a luxurious destination,"We are a family of 6 ( my 85 yearold father, 79 year old mother, my sis-in-law and his sons flew in from Canada and myself ),the room upgrade (Merlion Suite facing gardens by the bay)was very much appreaciated!My 2 nephews flew in from Canada and were celebratin their birthday as well, so having us all in 1 room was a big surprise as well as the complimentary cakes.The suite was of course luxurious, the complimentary tea, coffee, drinks and chocolates were a big hit.Booking is simple online, the check-in process could be improve especially for the unintiated like where do we look for the queue numbers although 1 unpleasant encounter was when a guest claimed that our queue number was his and proceeded to the counter , I was baffled as the prompt in my phone stated my check-in was completed already while we are still queueing up behind the counter. I needed to asked for help for this and turned out the guest claimed he has our queue number, the receptionist just proceeded to check him in without counter-checking like asked him to show the queue number from his phone. Anyway, the staff whom I called for help come to out rescue and all is good again.I am also gratefull that the wheelchair I requested for my 85 year old father was sent straight to the room, should’ve asked for my 79 year old mother as well If I only knew it would be easy to request.The room service butler was very responsive and the staffs sent to us for assistance for our needs were very respectful, knowledgeable and attentive , kudos to Leah( room -in dining dinner, very promptly she set up our table and has very friendly attitue)Cecil( gave the surprise cakes , she is very amicable and friendly)Nadrajan( our first contact after check-in, he asked if the wheelchair will be used at that time or we prefer to send in to our room and before he left the room he distinctly explained about what butler phone can do,the key cards although he explaine the electricity card but we cannot find the slot he was saying) ,the guy who brought our ice cubes whom I failed to get his name and the one who enlightened us about the electricity acrd which our room does not need to use it,the guy who brought in our breakfast but I failed to get his nameLaura from Infinity pool whom you can tell her sincerity in making sure we are taken cared of , she asked Leo to assist my dad and mom while they are visiting the pool. One not so good experience was during breakfast when we went down to RISE restaurant , our 2 rooms originally booked does not include breakfast but from what Mary staff from check in told us that we can go to RISE or SPAGO for breakfast without reservation, so when we queued up the staff from RISE asked for my name and room number and when she checked our original room has no inclusion of breakfast but I asked if we can still eat and pay , she said no so we just went back to our room and ordered in for room service. I called and checked why we were sent away, the phone butler staff checked then called again and claimed there was no record we approached RISE eventhough restaurant staff asked to spell out my name and after awhile called us to head down with already a table reserved for us but I declined since we already ordered for breakfast room service. I failed to get the RISE staff’s name as we were already flustered, anyway we moved on after that since we have the breakfast in our room already and proceeded to the Infinity pool, of course the reason we booked at MBS was the pool and we were not disappointed , from the booking for the date slot and the messages sent whether the pool is temporarily closed because of the inclement weather as well as its opening once available is very much helpful and as I mentioned Laura from the Infinity pool is a darling, she is very sincere. The photo also was an experience, the photographer was friendly and does not impose, it’s nice that other than the printed photos, the digital photos were available to the guests. Check-out was easy as can check out from the TV although as 2 rooms initially was booked only 1 room was billed and able to check out from the TV so needed to check put from the front desk , Victor helped us out from the front desk to check out and settle our bill for our stay. The Merlion suite of course has the wow factor already its spacious and clean,the furnitures are comfortable, the mini bar was well equipped, the toilet in the bathroom can have a bidet perhaps , the bathtub is super comfy, the massage room and the hair washing room does not come with any information how to use it though , the downside of staying in the Merlion Suite is we almost refused to leave the room. The overall experience we had was very memorable, and yes we will come and check-in again",Date of stay:
One night is not enough,"Stayed one night in transit thru Singapore. Management team upgraded us to an Orchid suite due to problem with our reservation. Also we found a cake waiting in our room to help us celebrate our anniversary. Very thoughtful! The room was spectacular with a wide view of the marina from a high floor. We waited about 30 minutes for our check in opportunity. We used the infinity pool deck and enjoyed our time there watching the sunset, and had some drinks and appetizers. The pool deck servers were very professional and efficient. It was a great stay, just too short. Thanks to the staff of the MBS!",Date of stay:

Massive and iconic,"We stayed a night in a garden view deluxe room and found it amazing. This is not a hotel, it is a resort with more than 2500 rooms.
Still, check in was rather effektive. (They use a lot of time everywhere in Singapore). Rooms were great with good amenties and great views of the gardens and the supertree grove.
We spent an intire day first row in the world renowned infinity pool. To be honest - this is why we booked a room here. One thing we did not understand is why the signage told that children had to be above 13 yrs to enter, but a lot of 7-8-9 yr old still splashed around, ruining the experience for other guests. Why???
Still - it was an amazing experience and is highly recommended :)",Date of stay:

This hotel, it’s rooms, the staff - everything is simply first class there are no words to describe the pure luxury of the entire package. We upgraded to the club room which was worth every single penny (the food and drink selection along then the amazingly friendly staff (I wish I could remember her name)).

Unforgettable memories,"We were fortunate enough to have a few nights in Singapore at the magestic Marina Bay Sands hotel.

The highlight for us was definitely Moe the lifeguard at the incredible infinity pool. He was friendly, attentive and showed genuine care in wanting our family to have the best experience during our stay.

He even took some wonderful photos of our family (very rare to have all of us in the picture) and gave some great tips on things to do to enjoy all that this amazing hotel offers.

Contented Guests,"My son and I had a staycation at your hotel recently. We did not quite have a good experience with your front office staff and we sort of were disappointed that we received such a reception at a renowned hotel like MBS.

After lugging our luggage to our allocated room, we headed for the pool without much of an expectation from the staff. Upon our arrival at the pool, we were pleasantly greeted by a Mr Moe, the lifeguard. He was such a jewel who changed our perspective of the hotel.

Mr Moe was pro-active in everything he did. He ensured not only me and my son, but everyone at the pool were well taken care of and had a good time. He took the initiative to show us around for the best location for photos and volunteered to take photos for us. He was careful while doing so, the rest of the hotel guests were not neglected.

He was jovial, very approachable and professional all the time. We can sense his sincerity in ensuring everyone had an enjoyable time despite at times he seemed busy. His service was impeccable. I would say he was very passionate with his job.

Mr Moe had such a magic touch that my son loves him so much that he is bugging me to bring him back someday to be entertained by Mr Moe again and most probably I will.

Finally, I would like to mention the restaurants served wonderfully curated dishes with well trained staff too. The room we had had a nice view of Gardens by the Bay and the night view from the pool was beyond words. Overall, the initial dismay was compensated.",Date of stay:
2 nights stay at the iconic Marina Bay Sands,"My family and I spent 2 nights at the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel, and were not disappointed. The rooms were exquisite, and the views from Spago and the pool on level 57 were spectacular. Whilst our check in process was very slow (took almost 50 minutes), the staff were apologetic and recovered somewhat by sending cake to both of our rooms as a gesture. We dined at Spago Pool side on the Friday, where we shared a few starter dishes, and then dined at Lavo on the Saturday - WOW!
The hotel rooms are beautiful, and the bathroom was amazing, double basin, shower and bath. Very spacious room with amazing views overlooking the gardens.
The staff were very responsive, the Covid Protocols were excellent, and the cleanliness was top drawer.
During our stay it was the reopening of the Marquee nightclub, and all tickets were sold out. Whilst having a pre-dinner drink at Rise Restaurant, we shared this with Daniel Whitelaw, the GM of Rise. Long story short, Daniel arranged entry for us on opening night through his contacts at Marquee - Exceptional Customer Service - above and beyond. Thank you Daniel, we really appreciated it - and what a great night to be at the re-opening.

We really enjoyed our stay, and are pleased we've had the opportunity to stay at this iconic hotel",Date of stay:

Hospitality was 100%,"Me and my partner arrived at the marina bay sands and immediately you were helped out of the car and your luggage was taken from a lovely gentleman. We then went to check in and as we waited in the queue for too long (all of 5 mins) they fast tracked us to another counter and upgraded our room to a higher floor for the inconvenience. We didn’t even complain but it was a lovely gesture. We then got to our room to find our luggage already there soon after a knock at the door with a lady wishing me happy birthday and handing over some cake which was a lovely touch! The pool was incredible and you get free snacks and drinks whilst you relax. We then went to watch the gardens by the bay light show from our room which we couldn’t believe we could see it so clearly! Later in the evening we went to the rooftop to see the view in the dark and a gentleman named Moe introduced himself and he offered to take photos for us by the pool. He made space in an area near the edge and went that extra mile to get some incredible photos for our memories. He also gave us some great tips to watch the sunrise so thank you Moe!

Glad we chose MBS,"We visited Singapore 10 years ago and promised our then 12 yr old daughter we would come back and stay at this iconic hotel. So what could be more fitting than first trip out after Covid and our daughter graduating and about to start work. It did not disappoint !! Arriving at 1.30am we were quickly checked in and upgraded to a magnificent room than was more than enough for the 3 of us overlooking garden by the bay. We loved having a balcony to have fresh air in the evening. On leaving our room to explore the amazing breakfast we were asked if our room could be cleaned ( at 9am !!!) and this continued throughout our stay . It was terrific to have the room sorted so early . All staff we encountered went out of their way to be approachable and helpful. The pool was just as amazing as we had pictured and we dined and drank all afternoon while watching amazing plane, helicopters and parachutes around us practice for national day. Unfortunately we did get a little baked as the cloud cover was a little deceptive and we stayed longer than planned…..ouch!!
We did not want to leave and will definitely be back …just really special place",Date of stay:
GEMS service from Ryan @ the pool,"Spent the whole day at the beautiful pool yesterday. Was observing how this life guard, Ryan was assisting the hotel guests. He was simply amazing.

He is definitely a valuable asset to MBS. Keep up the good work Ryan!. Thumbs up!",Date of stay:
15th Wedding Anniversary,"We arrived late afternoon. My husband and I hit the Infinity pool once we settled from checking in.

We are aware that taking photos is not Moe’s main duty in his workplace but he was so great in offering to take our photos! better than selfies😁.
For Moe , he set an example of giving his best to make guests feel welcome and belonging regardless of an individual’s race, colour and status.
Moe was also great in answering our questions about Singapore. He is a great ambassador for your resort.

"Fantastic hotel, location and class","This place did not disappoint. From checkin to customer service, hospitality and ambience. It matched all expectations and beyond. I arrived at check in and was ushered to the VIP check in as there was a large party being checked in together. This was great initiative by staff concerned.
The rooms were magnificent with all amenities, complimentary toiletries and even the mini bar was free. Lots of information and movies, programmes on the tv.
The harbour view room I had was immaculate and the view outstanding. It overlooked the Bay of Gardens and was beautiful and colourful at night.
The infinity pool was amazing and the complimentary juices and ice creams were an added treat.
Amazing view from the sky deck and even watching the water/light show every evening from 8pm was spectacular.
An array of cafes and restaurants and the Bayfront MRT all in close proximity.

The gym had everything including a steam room, mini pool and sauna. Great view from the treadmills too.

All I can say is that you must stay here to experience all it has to offer. It was worth it. Would recommend Marina Bay Sands and would more likely spend more time , next time . So clean and just an amazing ambience about the place.
I must make mention of my clean room daily was due to staff member , Wen Bin. He took pride in his work and endured our stay was pleasant.",Date of stay:
Recommend but wouldn’t rush back,"Arrived at Marina Bay for the last stint of our Honeymoon. At the time, check in was busy and seemed it couldn’t handle the capacity, despite arriving for our allocators time, we waited around 60-90mins to be checked in being passed from desk to desk which happens to be a walk between tower 1 and 3.

After getting checked in we got to our room and settled in. The rooms are amazing and the view incredible (city view) with great facilities and add ons with the complimentary mini bar, bottled water, snacks, etc. However we were put in a room next to a another under construction with continuous drilling/hammering starting at 9am and continuing way past 7pm. Although we didn’t plan to spend too much time in the room, it is still not something we paid the premium rate to listen too. Staff were quite good in getting us moved but again we had to pack up and wheel our suitcases again to another tower to settle back in.

Once out, the shops, restaurants and entertainment are amazing. From well known chefs to pub grub styles the selection and quality of food is incredible and the shops the same. There is a water show every evening I think one at 8pm and one at 9pm which is worth a watch!

Overall it is a great hotel with so much to see and do around the area but we just felt a bit let down and wondering whether it was worth the hype and money paid. Don’t forget to screenshot your check in time and register for infinity pool access on the days you want! Deposit of 400 Singapore Dollars was also a bit of a surprise as they take the full room rate with this as an addition.",Date of stay:
Absolutely AMAZING!!!!,I arrived around 1am after a very long day of travel. Check in was a breeze and I was so relieved when I got to my room. It was super clean and really comfortable. I was starving and at 1am room service still had a full menu of really great options and it was delivered in a very reasonable amount of time. Not to mention just how amazing the property itself is. A definite must see.,Date of stay:
THE HYPE IS REAL,"My partner and i stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights during June 2022. We stayed in Deluxe Room with a sky view located on the 45th floor. Our room was generous in size, was equipped with all of the facilities you require and the view was absolutely amazing, in my opinion well worth the extra money when compared to a lower floor view. The hotel's infinitely pool provides breathtaking entertainment to everybody, regardless of their age. The hotel is connected to a shopping centre that offers a casino, high end shopping and an endless amount of food options. Marina Bay Sands is highly recommended!",Date of stay:
Best hotel ever!!!!,"Wow what an experience, this hotel really is Luxury. Rooms are really big and so clean, the view from our room was amazing. Food is unreal and staff are very polite and friendly.

First Time Visit: Exceptional,"It was my first trip to Singapore, and a perfect opportunity to experience the iconic Marina Bay Sands. We got down to the business of gastronomy and locked in a few reservations at Wakuda, a relatively new addition offering contemporary Japanese cuisine by Tetsuya Wakuda, Daniel Boulud’s ‘db Bistro’ offers great variety, although we opted for comfort food; burgers and the steak tartare are firm favourites. Spago by Wolfgang Puck offers refinement, a rich menu with excellent choices and a wine list so impressive; that we struggled to choose. The knowledgeable sommelier really added value to our experience. Each one is distinctive, not only for its cuisine but the ambience and experience offered. CUT by Wolfgang Puck, was booked out, but we took up a seat at the bar, chatting with a talented bartender who has been with Marina Bay Sands for more than a decade. All in all – this resort is undeniably opulent but it’s the genuine professionalism, warmth and care of the entire team, within the hotel and the wider mall restaurant offering that made this such a memorable first for me. Before departure, a swim in the world's largest rooftop infinity pool was on my checklist, and the beautiful views and dramatic weather made it even more dramatic. Definitely recommend heading up before 8 am if you want the pool almost all to yourself. Ryan, one of the lifeguards on duty, loves what he does and is a keen photographer too. With a new fourth tower of Marina Bay Sands underway, there is good reason to return. Thank you for an incredible experience…",Date of stay:

The standard is perfect.",Date of stay:
Hopeless service and system,"Very bad experience there at MBS and never hope this kind of reception after paying lots..

Nobody's on gate open at any tower

You have to open gate yourself and get disinfected soon as you enter because all normal and genral public can roam and enjoy all facilities there roam around and all rather only then infinity pool.Lots of crowd at lobby but no sitting there you have to wait by standing in long cues and family have to suffer.

Room showing balcony but don't have

Club not for inhouse guest have not entitled because already blocked by outsiders.nobody have inform us that you have to book advance SKYBAR .Please let me know why I pay a lots just for ambiance that i not entitled to use
All amenities are common for public as well as hotel guest nothing special rather to making all fool.They have preferred for public more rather then guests.
I celebrate anniversary at Clark quay beacuse of bad behaviour by club entry they make us wait till 11 then denies

Long long waiting for room dinning and service calls.Some time you have to call up more then three four time which take you 10 to 15 mins for single service

Just u taking money only for infinity pool nothing else

It's a wastage of money and my day a very bad ever experienced i have with you.

Ok bang for big buck!,"As expected everything about marina bay sands is grand including its prices! Considering the high price you pay to stay there, customer service is patchy and inconsistent (from very good service most of the time to less than mediocre service some of the time). Security in accessing the Casino is more heightened (a little overkill) than immigration security at the airport! The infinity pool was nice and free ice cream was a plus (despite the pool being crowded due to school holidays). The free light show at the marina was spectacular (truly immersive and breathtaking). The floating apple store nearby was fun. If you can stay there without breaking the bank it’s worth it. The hotel room was nicely stocked and comfortable!",Date of stay:
Amazing,"Amazing!! There is not a thing out of place at this hotel! Staff throughout were attentive and extremely helpful. At the front desk we missed our appointed check in time, but we’re ushered through to check in anyway at the front desk. The lady there was very helpful and took us through all the perks/features of the hotel. Make sure you sign up for the MBS rewards card before you go so you can get the points. Make sure you scan it everytime you go shopping or dine in. The rewards are well worth it. At the Infinity Pool we had Moe play photographer (his one of the many lifesavers). Then throughout the day they hand out free ice creams and juices. I love that there is a adults only section of the infinity pool. Plenty of staff on offer if you wish to purchase food or drinks. Only down side is that the bar/food closes early. But you can access the pool until later. Housekeeping are amazing! Leaving little treats for us throughout our week long stay. Staying here was definitely an experience that I fully appreciated and will never forget.",Date of stay:
An experience to remember!,"If this is your first time to Singapore, staying here is a must. It is expensive but it’s worth the money. If you want to save money, go through Booking.com, but the rooms you’ll get will be the lower floors and least desirable. If you book directly with the hotel, you may get the better rooms. I would double check both sites first to compare the rates before you book.

Now, let’s talk about the hotel. It’s iconic and the most beautiful hotel in the city. The location is unbeatable. You can literally spend a week there if you could afford it. There’s three main towers connected by a long lobby on the bottom and the infinity pool on top. You have to be a guest in order to use the infinity pool. The hotel is connected by two underground walkways to a shopping complex that has many stores, a food court, restaurants, theater, art museum and casino. The casino has no entrance fee if you’re a visitor so you need to present a passport. To discourage locals from gambling, they charge $150 entrance fee for locals.

The entire is part of the Marina Bay Sands. It’s huge! The food court has very good food. Think of it as a food stand except it’s a lot cleaner. The price is also a bit more expensive compared to the food hawker center in the city. There’s high end restaurants in here as well. Expect to pay over $150 per person for dinner.

The location is unbeatable. You can walk across a bridge to get to Garden by the Bay. Early in the morning when it’s less hot and humid, you can walk around the bay to the Fullerton Hotel.

The rooms are nice and the service is impeccable. Our room was serviced twice a day. They even offer free water bottles. Everything is so clean and the people are super nice!

The best part is not just the pool, but the experience of staying there. The vibe is up eating and you can just feel like you’re in the moment by staying here. I would definitely come back here again.

We did have an issue with our check in but I won’t lower the ratings because that would not be fair. We had 2 rooms near each other on the fifth floor for an early check in at around 9:45am. We were told that we can wait until a higher level is available for 2 rooms. They said they can’t say what level, but it would be higher than the fifth floor. Would you be tempted by this offer? Well, our temptations got the best of us and we agreed, only to realize fifteen minutes that we would be room less until 4pm and where are we going to store our luggages and change our clothes even if we want to swimming? Within fifteen minutes, we came back ti the front desk and said that we would want one if the room in the fifth floor and wait for the second room. They said that the room on the 5th floor is no longer available, and they only have the 4th floor available. Sure, we take it since we were going yo get a room on the higher floor anyway. Later on, around 2pm? we checked back and they have room ready for us. We were excited. They gave us a higher room than the fifth floor like they said. They gave us a room on the 6th floor. I kid you not! I can’t believe a high end hotel that prides itself in customer service would actually offer a guest to give up 2 rooms on the 5th floor that’s ready for an early check in so that they can wait without a room for another four hours and can get a higher room on the 6th floor! I felt like I was part of some comedy show where the joke was on me. Or it was an important lesson to be happy with what you have instead of taking an offer for something better? I didn’t know MBS offers life lessons as well?",Date of stay:
Amazing and not to be missed!,"We stayed for 4 nights in Orchard Suite. Overall we had an amazing experience and staff were outstanding! We were very well looked after by the staff, who even left us a nice welcome surprise in our room as they were aware we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary.
It is a busy hotel and at times you will have to queue but this is expected when you staying at 2000+ room hotel! The staff did an amazing job to look after us and room and food choice was excellent. We used Club 55 which is definitely worth the upgrade and never had any lunch as we were so full up with afternoon tea and evening drinks. The complimentary water/juices/ice cream at infinity pool is a nice touch and again staff went out of their way to ensure you had a wonderful experience in the pool area. Definitely use the jacuzzi!! The pool was busy on weekend but very quiet on weekdays.
Lots of reviews complain about queues?? Not sure what they expect when they are visiting one of the largest hotels in the world?? You have many boutique hotels in Singapore- so stay there! Also the hotel staff encouraged guests to try and avoid breakfast between 8.30am and 9.30am as this was peak period. We always had breakfast around 8am and only queued once. Again weekend breakfast was busier than weekday.
The hotel is walking distance to many attractions and the MRT station can be accessed from the hotel. The MRT Line that serves the station - also serves Little India and Haji Lane. The other 2 main destinations of Chinatown and Orchard Lane are only a few stops away from the hotel (have to change once). The connected shopping mall has lots of high end shops as well as many food choices. I would recommend taking a walk around the marina and visiting the Hawker food court that is next to outside theatre - food was amazing and a lot cheaper than the restaurants in the mall.
Lastly a huge thank you to Shataz Ho (premium service/front desk) who was absolutely amazing throughout our stay.
We will definitely be back to stay at this wonderful and amazing hotel!!",Date of stay:
"The pool and hot jacuzzi are awesome! Nice view, good music!","Room is big, bathroom very spacious. The infinity pool is the best of course! But it looks best on a sunny day. Don’t miss out the hot jacuzzi bath that is overlooking gardens by the bay! It has nightly performances at 7.45 and 8.45pm

A wonderful weekend stay!
I want to go back again!",Date of stay:
A must do,"This hotel is a must do in Singapore because of it’s amazing pool and the views. We had 2 rooms, one on 21st floor and one on 48th floor and both had the harbour view. I would totally recommend them over the city view rooms. Not only I think that the garden/harbour view is simply nicer but also because they have balconies which is amazing in the evenings as you can look at the many ships and the gardens by the bay. The lower floor room had a really big balcony and a super close view of the light and music show in the gardens. The upper floor room had a small balcony so could only stand there or alternatively sit in the room with the doors open. Both were great for different reasons. If I could have any negative comment then I wasn’t too impressed with the bed. It was rather on the small side (definitely not king size) and not really comfortable. The toiletries in the bathroom smelt divine on the other hand! The highlight of course is the lovely pool with panoramic views and we were there for hours during the days and in the evenings. It was a bit crowded at times but still totally worth a visit. I would absolutely stay again. It’s pricey especially as it’s room only. For comparison we stayed in a different hotel in Singapore which is also lovely, centrally located and we paid 20% less for a much larger and nicer room with panoramic views. The hotel also had a lovely infinity pool with gorgeous views of the city including MBS and the price included a generous breakfast and afternoon snacks/cocktails. Of course the pool wasn’t anywhere near as big or iconic as the one in MBS but also lovely and more intimate. Overall I would definitely return to both.",Date of stay:
View from the rooms is to die for.,"The hotel is huge and connected to a mall. The best part of the hotel is its infinity pool on the 57th floor, the view is just breath taking. We took the city side rooms and it was a great view from the room. The room size is also good for the price you pay. This is the first hotel i have experienced where even kids had their individual key card. Kids felt special when they got their own key cards. the sofa cum bed dint have the best comfort, but was ok. they should have provided with a little more thicker beds. We would feel the springs in the sofa cum beds. The main beds were very comfortable. No complains there.",Date of stay:
Luxury,Treated like a queen and king from the moment we walked in. The room over looked the gardens and was huge. Please if you stay book into restaurants before you get there the first night we were there we couldn’t get in anywhere and most restaurants were booked out for a few days. However the room service menu was amazing had one of the best dinners in our room. The shops of course are 5 star so make sure you have money. In all it was a Great experience and would stay again,Date of stay:
Brilliant stay!,Had a brilliant time from start to finish. Room was stunning - 53rd floor overlooking the gardens was really worth it. Staff were super helpful and friendly. Pool was as amazing as all the pictures. So many hotels in Singapore but definitely recommend this one! It was much busier at the weekend so if you can stay mid-week it would make it perfect.,Date of stay:
Family friendly resort feel more than 5 star luxury,"We have always wanted to stay here after seeing the beautiful photos of the pool and building. The property is huge and on the pricey side. We upgraded to a harbor view room which had a lovely view. The room itself was nothing special and did show signs of wear, but was clean. They provided lots if bottled water in the room which was nice.
The pools view is as spectacular as you see in photos, BUT what they don’t show you is how crowded it actually is with screaming splashing children alllllll over (not just in the children’s pool) . Because of this we stayed mostly in the small adults only area which was on one of the far corners of the pool.
The restaurants by the pool all require a dress code, men collar shirts and no sandals, pool wear not allowed which we found odd since they are in the pool area.
There were lines for almost everything in the hotel also which we didn’t care for.
The service was very good and everyone was very nice, but we prefer a more personal feel in a hotel when traveling. We are happy we tried it, but would definitely not stay here again. We were wanting a 5 star luxury experience and it felt more like a family resort.",Date of stay:
Famous landmark and pool,"Staying here for 2 weeks. Maybe due to tower 2 closed for renovations, the hotel is near full occupancy. Couldn’t book a suite and settled for a room with “garden” view. The garden is the supertree grove so pretty cool. Got a low 12th floor so pretty disappinted

The porter is helpful, the front desk pretty grumpy. The rest of the staff from housekeeping to operators to gym/pool staff are thankfully as pleasant as the porter

The room is ok sized with a generous balcony and 50-60 inch flat screen tv. The bed is disapponting - not king sized nor luxurious. Towels too, are worn and cheap feeling. So no 5 star luxury feels here

Because the hotel is huge with 3 towers, it is extra exercise walking to the gym and pool. The gym is large and ok. The world famous pool is always crowded as expected, but nice since it’s 57 stories up

For convenience, the shopping mall is connected and you can literally get and eat anything there

Rooftop Infinity Pool sets this place from other places with better food and service,"Great trip to Singapore as part of a leg to Maldives from UK. The hotel was our first choice and although more expensive than some other local luxury options it was worth it overall.

Rooftop infinity pool sets this place apart not the service or rooms or food.",Date of stay:
Excellent hotel but shocking breakfast service!,"The hotel is beautiful and the infinity pool is incredible! It’s a real flaw that you can only access the pool from tower 3 and not the other 2 towers. Staff were excellent throughout except for at breakfast. Breakfast service in the Rise was extremely poor. We had to wait 15-20 minutes in large queues, even when there were empty tables that were simply not being cleaned. In a hotel that prides itself on efficiency, this was very poor. Even getting water at breakfast was bad as the lady “serving” kept running out of glasses and took ages to get new ones. One elderly guest even resorted to bringing a bowl to get water as they needed some to take their medication! Overall the hotel and service was excellent but breakfast service was utterly terrible and needs to be sorted.",Date of stay:
MBS most memorable stay,"We stayed 5 nights in a harbour view room on level 42.
Checkin was quick and we were made to feel welcome.
Room was spacious and the views spectacular. Bed and pillows are a little on the hard side.
Obviously we stayed here to experience the infinity pool and it didn’t disappoint. Pool and bar staff are amazing. Special shout out to Maurice, Mary & Ryan.
Location is also close to so many attractions and food options.
Only small criticism we have is the breakfast in Spago. The manger should take a trip to W @ Sentosa to see how a breakfast should be done.
Having said that it didn’t affect our stay and we loved every minute of our time here and will be back for sure. Everyone at the hotel went above and beyond to make sure our stay was memorable and it made for one of the best holidays we have ever had.",Date of stay:
Just have to do it once- top of the line!,"One of the reasons we did a stop over in Singapore was to stay at this hotel. Yes, its almost $500 a night. They were very outgoing- allowed us to check in early at 930am- which is virtually unheard of anywhere. They also upgraded us to a king bed high floor with views of the gardens. Staff are outstanding. Facility is beautiful- beyond words. Infinity pool awesome- no longer any limits on time you can spend at the pool. Food super pricey as expected. 3 mini sliders and 2 drinks at the pool for $70 USD. Highly recommend 1 night stay for the experience. Free water and soft drinks in the room fridge is a nice touch.",Date of stay:
Excellent Dinning Experience & Divine Delicacies at Blue Pearl Restaurant @ MBS,"If you are looking for an enchanting and memorable dinning experience, dinning at Blue Pearl Restaurant located at Marina Bay Sands (2nd level inside the Casino) will definitely not disappoint you.

On 25 May 2022 at about 7.15pm, I and one of my food buddies were warmly welcome by Marcus Choong,  the AGM of Blue Pearl Restaurant and he then led us to our dinning table which is at a secluded corner of the said restaurant. This is our 4th or 5th visit to Blue Pearl, and we cannot stop returning because of the delicacies created by the Chief Chef, Jason Lau have always been scrumptious and delectable.

As there were only two of us, we decided to have a simple meal.  We told Marcus we wanted a fish, a lobster noodle and a dessert to complete our meal.  Marcus simled and told us that Jason, the Chief Chef was around and the latter would handle our request personally.

The first dish that Jason presented us was the 'Fried Garoupa with Asparagus'. The garoupa was super tender and fresh, and the asparagus did na good job in complementing the said dish.  The bones of the garoupa were deep fried and became another added delicious dish.

The presentation of the 'Lobster Noodle' was both creative and astonishing. The crispy fried noodle was delightful and the main star of this dish (lobster) was utterly enchanting with its freshness, firm and bouncy flesh. I am not a fan for lobster as I always find the lobster either overcooked or not easy to eat.  Nonetheless, this lobster was so far the best lobster that I have tasted.

'Bird's Nest in Papaya' was the dessert that Jason presented to us  The papaya was double-boil and cut into half before it was filled up with bird's nest and milk.  It was served hot and left us speechless and wanting for more.

We managed to take photos of all the 3 dishes and hope to share with foodies who will be able to appreciate good food and fine dinning experience.

All this wonderful experience will not be possible without Marcus Choong and this team of professional serving staff, and the super creative Chief Chef, Jason Lau of Blue Pearl Resturant.

Yours Sincerely,

Danny Lim",Date of stay:
Awesome,"Lots to say, firstly I would like to thank all the staff from check in at reception to the pool attendants to housekeeping all were absolutely lovely and so accommodating.
I had a beautiful room with the most amazing views of the Bay with so many ships to see and also overlooking the Gardens by the Bay which were wonderful especially at night when all lit up.
Breakfast was at Club55 where I would like to thank the following staff for their service and fabulous hospitality Raja the Manager, Junemay, Kate, Jessen, Hui ting, and Vincent. their service was outstanding. Had some lovely conversations with them.
Rise Restaurant Buffet, Food on buffet is amazing with the most fantastic Seafood Platter. All staff are very friendly especially the hosts and servers.
Renku Club, had some beautiful canapes and cocktails while listening to a pianist playing in the background. Service staff were very attentive and lovely.

"Great view, but train station feeling","Stayed in many 5 Star Hotels in Singapore over the years. The MBS has clearly a great view! Impressive!

Yet, the lobby is like a train station, busy noisy, friendly yet very nusy staff. Breakfast isn't recommended, but Chinese lunch was ok to good.

The pool and view terrace on top of the iconic building is a bit over regulated. Certain areas couldn't be accessed for picturing (alneit bekng empty) and it was entirely clear why the staff follows such procedures.

Rooms are good but a bit dated. Gym is great, good views, and friendly staff.

I wouldn't want to stay there and rather pick other places.",Date of stay:
Best hotel in Singapore and worth every penny!!,"Awesome hotel with the best views, location and service. It was amazing to watch the spectra light and water show from our room.

Definitely the best hotel in Singapore!",Date of stay:
Room Service,"This is purely about their room service.

It took 5 mins for them to respond and they informed us that they had wait times of over an hour. This is ridiculous for a 5 star hotel that I am paying nearly SGD2000. Unheard of anywhere else in the world, but in Singapore, all they say is suck it.

I am still here.",Date of stay:
Perfect destination for luxurious holidays,"We had stayed there specifically for the reason to access their trademark Infinity pool with a view of singapore skyline. And we were not disappointed. We were able to access the pool as many times as we want. The pool is opened from 6 Am to 11 Pm. The water is good, the service is perfect, they have people serving refreshments along the pool sides at no extra cost.

The rooms are luxurious with perfect services for in room dining as well. Particularly Mr. Sean had taken care that my 3 year old baby is also served well. Brought some in house chocolates for her along with my beer tasting bucket. They extended our check out till 2 PM. Which was very convenient with 2 babies.

Overall it was a perfect experience with quality service and with proper amenities and a pleasant experience for my family of 4.",Date of stay:

Luxurious property,"We booked a Deluxe King Sky View Room on the 44th floor. It was a very spacious room with an amazing view. The team was nice enough to provide us with an early check-in. The service was pretty quick as our luggage had reached the room before us and the extra bed was placed within 5 minutes of that.

The pool is obviously amazing at any point of time and they have amazing hot tubs as well. The drinks in the pool are not that costly. Sling or pina colada costs SGD 25-26 (inclusive of taxes).

I would suggest anyone who is visiting Singapore to stay on this hotel for at least one night and enjoy the property, be it the room, pool, casino or mall.",Date of stay:
Living in Opulence!,"Stay: 4th May to 5th May 2022

Booking: Self

Review:

Value for Money: Booked the Deluxe Room (Garden View) directly through mail interaction with their reservation desk @ Sing Dollar (SGD) 1,046.35/- per night which is a luxury but totally worth it. We got bumped up the Deluxe Room King size (Garden view) Tower 2 which sweetened the deal. The room is on the 47th floor and had the Gardens view

Service Quality: Awesome. Hotel staff is accommodating in every sense of the word. Smooth check-in and very comfortable

Food & Drink: The hotel has lots of choices to choose from and the same can be browsed from the in-room TV menu. There is a rooftop restaurant Spago where one can enjoy their evening swims with food and drink. You may choose to have your meals at the bay area

Location: Needs no introduction! Marquee hotel in Singapore

Amenities: Two words - INFINITY POOL!!! There is free WI-Fi. There is the casino, Sands Expo and convention halls. The AC chills you quite comfortably. There is 24x7 hot water. Once again the pool with the view is a must visit. Also visit the Observatory deck which comes as part of the room package

Special mention: Did I mention it earlier...go dive into the pool! Superb connectivity via the MRT. Take a morning stroll around the bay area, click pics with the Merlion, go visit the Helix bridge",Date of stay:

The staff give us complimentary beverages during swimming session in the evening on last Friday, May 6 with this pleasant thought. We will come back again.",Date of stay:
Infinity Pool is Amazing,"My wife and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for three nights in May of 2022. Would I recommend this resort to a friend? Yes. Would I stay their again knowing what I know now about the resort? Yes.

We had a Deluxe King Sky View. It had great views of the city and skyline. The only reason we stayed at the hot was for access to the roof top infinity pool. It it wasn’t for the pool I would not stay at the hotel. It doesn’t feel like you are staying in a hotel. It feels like you are staying in a mall. The hotel is big and impersonal.

The pool is great. Amazing views of the city. However, my wife and I were wanting to have a drink in the pool and watch the sun set. Sounds great doesn’t it. But the pool area does not have an adult only section or pool. This means that there are always screaming splashing kids around you. Don’t get me wrong, I raised two screaming splashing kids. However when you’re paying $1000/night for a room, an adult only section in the pool isn’t too much to ask for.

Additionally, my wife loves to have a bath before bed and the deluxe rooms only have showers.

WI-FI in the rooms was strong. Free waters and sodas in the room were a nice touch. Also the free ice cream at the pool.

We signed up for the Sands reward club and got free breakfast at Spagos and a free happy hour one night.

He made sure that we have all what we need from the towels, water and even the free ice cream that was served. We were all satisfied even there's a limited time for swimming.

Couldn’t wait to stay but was RESTRICTED AF,"Pool rules of 1hr per person per day had just gone. Yet we still had to check in. It was a bit of a mess. We would all line up in the heat and some people couldn’t get the thing to work. Not the best when youve been dying to visit the most iconic pool in the world. We couldn’t get a drink and swim because there are only certain times for that. So had to plan accordingly. Whatever happened to pool side service? I literally only stayed for the pool. The casino was a nightmare. No drinks in sight. That’s changed. You can’t even get a water. One night I went downstairs at 10pm to visit 7/11 and was stopped by security. “CLOSED” but was told by staff it’s open. Hotel check in took forever be aware of this as it eats into pool and dinner time. Checkout is a breeze with the card drop. Room service took 50-80 mins. Spagos service was lovely. If your in the mood for a nice pool, club service and fun go to Royal Park Pickering I stayed there same time in April 22 and rate it more.",Date of stay:

She took care of everything, she even upgraded my room as i mentioned that it was my first time to stay in that hotel. Everything was perfect and seamless. RJ helped me booked for the swimming pool when she asked if I made a booking already, but i did not. She explained everything that I need even for the pre departure pcr test that we need for my flight. She was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The restaurants are awesome, and the hotel is very convenient to go for shopping since everything is just a few minutes walk away from the hotel.

At the bar outlets (Ce La Vi & Lavo) the front of house staff were rude and unhelpful.

Our Stay at Marina Bay Sands (April 2022 Rm# 4670),"Eileen of Guest Services from Marina Bay Sands is cool, helpful and kind! Always there to help and help! I appreciate her when she made me feel good when I encountered a not so kind Guest Services Officer of Marina Bay upon checking in. Then again when my battery is almost empty after I came from Singapore International Water Week 2022, she lend me her pwerbank and eventually gave it to me. Eileen is constantly willing to help. I think that’s her nature and her job is suited for her. I would like also to comment for Michelle, their Front Desk Manager, the 2nd person I met upon checkin. Super super kind and helpful too! She’s very knowledgeable in her field. She assisted me all the way until we settled and get our room. Also Rj in Front Desk is super kind the 3rd person I met in Marina Bay Sands is super super kind too! Shouting out for these wonderful people, including Ramesh and Xavier of Front Desk the wonderful people I met eventually on our Stay there. Also Wee Hong and all the people from Infinity Pool and Liang the photographer. I would like also to shoutout the people we encountered in Spago, Mark the German from Rise and others(sorry I forgot their names) and Club 55. Thank you to them. Hoping to encounter all these wonderful people again when we go back this September for the F1 Grand Prix. I thank all these people. May God bless them all!!!",Date of stay:
Friendliest lifeguard I have met,"The stay itself was very pleasant and amazing, not to mention the fantastic hospitality and brightness of the staff. Especially a lifeguard by the infinity pool, Moe. He's extremely friendly and is more than willing to snap pictures for you. Not to mention, the shots he takes look as if a professional photographer had taken it. He also knows every good spot to take those pictures at, so don't worry about ideas of places to take photos! Moe was also very helpful and happy to assist all the time with a huge smile plastered on his face. You can easily strike up a conversation with him and he would be more than glad to share more about Marina Bay Sands. Overall, this hotel stay was excellent and I would 100% come again",Date of stay:
A must do in Singapore,"This is a must do. Enjoy the sunset in the many roof top bars/eateries. Great service, great vibe.
Id you can, stay a night - otherwise a visit is the next best choice. Great food, pricey, but high quality and superb service. Even when busy, they don't rush you. But you MUST book in advance.",Date of stay:
Crazy Rich Asians feeling Top of the world hotel,"Indulge and stay at the iconic hotel to get the best view of Singapore . City and sea views and Gardens by the Bay . Swim at the worlds largest infinity pool . Check in was virtual and seamless. Attention to detail was given in housekeeping with clothes being folded, chargers , cables were all coiled up , slippers, dressing gowns changed daily amenities , water , drinks , snacks were topped up daily . The infinity pool gave complimentary ice cream and juice . Service was with a smile. Location perfect with access to MRT, shops and restaurants.",Date of stay:
Fun vibe and great pool,First time in Singapore and we had a blast. Concierge staff (especially Xavier and Jen) were amazing. Moe at the pool was so friendly and helpful and truly represents what guest services is supposed to be about. Staff at Spago a little pretentious but lots of other places to eat,Date of stay:
Service unparalleled,"Friendly staff throughout our staff, from entering the hotel a lady who was checking for Tracetogether checkin helped me register and showed me what to do to speed up the check in process (which I will need to be doing everywhere I go in Singapore).

Checkin process is a efficient as they had virtual queue in which you put down your name and number then it will notify you once you're ready to be served (so you are able to browse around or sit down somewhere nearby without standing in line). We didn't have a SG number so we were standing infant of the numbering machine waiting. I had a few questions about Singapore and where I could get sims/travel cards etc so I asked Joseph who was there assisting guests to get a virtual queue number. It was a quiet time so there was nobody except for us and Joseph patiently answered all our queries cracking a joke every now and then which made the waiting a lot shorter! We also had a little complain which we ranted to him about, without telling us he went and did what he could to help us resolve the issue which made our stay 110% better as we know we were in good hands.

When leaving we had to collect our luggage from the concierge as we had it stored when checking out, Imad or Iman (apologies for forgetting) assisted us to collect our luggage. He then asked us how we were leaving and remembered the plate number by repeating it multiple times of the car picking us up. He then waited with us to ensure that as soon as the car came he could asks his colleagues and help us get our luggage in the car. Definitely not part of his job to do that but the extra level of care and service he provided made us felt warm leaving MBS.

PS. Pool was amazing and there weren't as many people as we were expecting (8:50-10:05 time)! very very enjoyable experience. Thank you again Joseph, Imad and the team at MBS",Date of stay:
Definitely worth while!!,"Thanks MBS, fantastic, Came for Lunch stayed for the Sunset!!
I would highly recommend the MBS for anyone coming to Singapore!!
My partner and I booked into MBS for lunch on the Saturday of our trip to Singapore,
Expensive?,not cheap but not expensive, you pay for an experience!!,
Let Sanji and Ozzie take you on an amazing experience of food, some drinks and a view to die for chucked in.
We started with lunch, my partner had the bottomless Mimosa, I had a bottle of wine, beautiful flavors in the food,
We ended up staying for expresso martini’s and cocktails and witnessing the fabulous views of Singapore at night

She said yes!,"We stayed during the good friday weekend, the place was crowded but we never had to wait for more than 10 minutes to be serviced. Breakfast queue was long, but we were acknowledged by the F&B staff which is appreciated.

Booked the hotel to propose to my girlfriend and the concierge team were legends. I will like to give acknowledgement to Alan.

I was due to check in on friday and I went down to the hotel on Thursday to make plans with the team. Alan made sure to keep the large bouquet of roses I bought were safe. He even went the extra step to find a place where it could be stored in the fridge for me.

On arrival, some plans changed and I texted him (secretly) to see if he could place the items in room whilst I stall her at the check-in counter. Sure enough, he made it happen. We went up to the room and it was displayed nicely for her eyes to see.

Proposal went smooth, and Alan event sent a bottle of Champagne for us to celebrate the occasion.

Legends.

As an ex hotelier, I am very impressed by the seamless service that was provided by Marina Bay Sands.

In room dining was good too, the staff made us feel like we were dining in the restaurant when he presented us with our food.

10/10 would return. Maybe for our wedding anniversaries. hehe

Thank You so much to MBS, Alan and Team. You gave us a wonderful weekend <3

Fantastic experience! Highly recommended!,"This was our second stay in MBS, however, I couldn't post a review previously as we had to cut our stay short due to my baby falling sick.

This time, we had a staycation for 4D3N during CNY2022 and it's lovely experience.
The moment you enter hotel premises, you're made to feel why MBS is worth the hype and more!
Check-in process was smooth despite the large crowd & the staff members ensured everyone is well attended to. We proceeded to our room and the luggage arrived soon after.
Room size was good enough. Very clean and pleasant with a beautiful view from the balcony. All the amenities are high quality and well maintained. Loved the bathroom :)
Services are pretty quick and the concierge/room service respond to calls in almost no time. Very impressive, considering the hotel was almost full capacity.
I was overjoyed to see plenty of options in breakfast for my dietary requirements (vegetarian, allergic to eggs) and they're delicious! The breakfast place is very well maintained with nice & warm staffs. They're very helpful in adjusting to my baby's mood who went bit noisy & started dropping cutlery at one point. Thanks for that and apologies for the inconvenience.
In-room dining service is bit expensive but quality is good with adequate portions. They serve within the stipulated time. No delays.
We also explored the infinity pool and observation deck, and both are totally worth the praise. We've been to observation deck couple of times earlier as well, however, infinity pool was just second time as it's limited only for hotel guests.
We can't wait enough to book another staycation with MBS as it never ceases to amaze us with its grandeur and services which is world class.
Kudos to the team! You're doing a wonderful job!!",Date of stay:
Heavenly Stay at the Top,"Despite the size and scale of its operations, I never had to wait in line or queue for very long. I guess having been in operation since 2010 has allowed for improvements over the years. The check-in process was a breeze, and I was only at the front desk for less than 7 minutes when I was handed my key; and off I went. Being an avid cyclist, the fact that I could store my bicycle was a definite plus!

What struck me the most as I entered the room was the enormity of it. The hotel did not stinge on space for their rooms. My room was well maintained, with guest amenities aplenty. I would have liked for a bottle of mouthwash though, and one or two of the electrical sockets did not seem to work well. I had to press down my phone changer plug to get it connected. But these were minor issues and I did not let them ruin my stay.

The chatbot was a great help attending to my enquiries, especially with the booking of the pool slots and the numerous dining options.",Date of stay:
"MBS a ""must stay"" destination","Our 20th yr. anniversary, we wanted to ""go big"" and chose Dubai and Singapore to stay. Both places were great, but MBS outshined everything we hoped for. from the staff to the amenities everything was top notched. City was clean and healthy, as was the hotel. The view from the ""Worlds highest infinity pool"" was to die for. It was breathtaking to walk out and see the city down below. The botanical gardens display was great.",Date of stay:
Marina Bay Pre-Departure Testing,Do not go there for pre-departure test if you want to avoid headache stress and hassle. better queue at GP or elsewhere will be worth the trip as this mini booth at convention center for pre-departure test will anyway keep you waiting too long and get the info on your documents wrong,Date of stay:
"Comment as promised, fr. Bere to Moe","Stayed one night in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, room was amazing: spacious, clean, comfortable bed and huge bathtub. As I booked at the counter and mentioned that I would leave early in the morning, they gave me a room at the upper level, with beautiful view. Of course I went to the infinity pool; as it was early in the morning, there were few people and I could enjoy the pool and also meet Mr. Moe, with who I shared interesting conversation about Singapore and traveling the world. Breakfast at the Spago was delicious, I recommend Asian food.",Date of stay:

Great Staff...Must Visit Mr. Moe at The Pool,"As a solo traveler visiting Singapore for the first time I must say my MBS experience was its amazing. The Room and the surrounding views are 2nd to none and the staff were great; in particular lifeguard Mr. Moe. Moe is ""True Service"", someone who deeply cares about other peoples experiences, someone whos kindness shows in everything he does. Moe always made sure I was taken care of, be it by the pool or with his advise on sites to see while in Singapore.

A great getaway for a special occasion with the family,"Perfect (& costly) getaway for the Family. Customer service is excellent given the many service staff everywhere. We are assigned a unit in Tower 1 for our 3 nights stay on the 46th level facing the sea. The view is simply spectacular. Checking in took about 30 minutes on a Sun afternoon but checking out is a breeze. One just need to drop your card keys into the quick checkout stand located outside the lift lobby. Booking for the infinity pool located on level 57 is simple, either via SMS or by scanning the QR code on the check in brochure. Same goes for the Banyan GYM on level 55 in Tower 2. Dining in the hotel will set you back by about S$80 to $100 per pax. Comparatively, the food court in basement 2 of the convention centre just opposite the hotel accessible via the underground passage is cheaper. Bathroom is huge with a standalone bathtub and toothbrushes are replaced everyday. There are lots of complimentary bottled water, coke, sprite, apple and orange juice that are replenished everyday with the snacks and tea. The coffee maker brewed fresh coffee. Room is huge with lots of mirrors and the sleep quality is good. Bathrobes and house slippers are changed daily too. Last but not least, the hotel surprised us with a slice of complimentary birthday cake left in the room while we were out celebrating. Kudos for the excellent customer service!!",Date of stay:

Fabulous hotel ... but don't expect to seep on Saturday night!,"The hotel is lovely - we've had fantastic meals in a couple of the restaurants (Spago, Lavo), have been to the infinity pool and had breakfast at Rise. The staff overall have been lovely and super helpful.
As with anything, you need to pick your time well if you want to avoid the queues. Just in from Australia, we were in Rise for breakfast at 7am - no queues. We also visited the infinity pool at 9am rather than one of the busier parts of the day. Yes it can be busy but you can plan around it.
The downside that you can't plan around, is the behaviour of other guests. On a Saturday night, the hotel is 'party central' with people coming back from other venues and 'kicking on' in their rooms. The music has thumped incessantly from about 3am to 6.15 so far and no signs of it slowing down yet. We'll be back for sure, but probably not to stay the night and definitely not on a Saturday night. Cann me 'old', but I like sleep ...!",Date of stay:
Amazing location & facility. That’s it though.,"This is an amazing place, the location is incredible and the facility has great amenities.
However this is where it begins and ends.

Breakfast- wait in a line for up to 10 mins to be seated each morning. Wait in another line for up to 10 mins at most food station. A very uneasy and stressful way to begin your day on a vacation.

Staff- perhaps due to covid, bad management or lack of care the staff are generally quite rude.
Particularly the staff at the pool area. It’s closer to an asylum rather than a pool. From being greeted with “are you going to your room’ rather than a hello or good morning. Good luck using your own infinity pool also, you’ll need to book each day of your generous 45 mins of pool time at least 1 week In advance.
I will say this is not to the valet staff, they were all very friendly and helpful.

In room dining- we ordered numerous times and had phone them back again to ask for our change as the staff thought they could take $20 tips for $30 meals.

Would never come back here nor recommend this hotel to anybody.",Date of stay:

Fabulous Experience,"We booked a Grand Club garden view room overlooking Gardens by the Bay on one side and overlooking the city from the bathroom.

We also had access to Club55 with our room which gave us breakfast here, in Spago or in the regular breakfast area. We also enjoyed an afternoon tea which was included.

The suite was truly incredible and the service we received was very professional. We didn’t have to queue for the lifts as others have mentioned. We managed to book 1hr 15 minutes each day of our stay at the pool. There was plenty of slots available which meant we could go in the morning and the evening for photos.

The breakfast at Spago was brilliant, the portion sizes are huge and it’s very tasty. The room service options are vast, plenty of options to choose from either Asian influenced dishes, Western dishes or authentic Singaporean dishes.

We wanted to stay for the swimming pool and the incredible views, but wasn’t expecting the service to be as good due to the vast size of the hotel but it was honestly faultless. Truly one of the best hotels we’ve visited.",Date of stay:
Excellent Staycation for celebrations!,"We checked in at MBS on 26th Feb and we are very pleased with the entire experience. Right upon arrival, we were graciously welcomed by Mr Ramesh and I had an excellent experience checking in at my designated time. I would like to thank Ms Lecia at the front desk who assisted me with a pleasant check-in experience and a wonderful room at Tower 2 on the 45th floor facing the Gardens and Harbour view.
My mom was very pleased with the spacious room and we are truly appreciative of the scenic views especially at night with all the lights from Gardens by The Bay!
I would also like to extend our heartfelt appreciation for the wonderful birthday cakes delivered to the room, it was indeed a touching gesture.
Thank you to the excellent bell-hop services too and we appreciate the assistance from arrival to departure with our luggage; special thanks to Mr Marvin & Mr Philip who assisted us with our luggage to & from our rooms, thank you to Mr Shasi, Mr Suresh and Mr Abdul Majid too at the Lobby who helped us with our luggage off and on our ride back home.
We felt the ohana vibes and we will definitely be regular visitors for future celebrations and staycations at MBS.
For guests who are considering to stay at this hotel, please sign up for the Sands Rewards Lifestyle card too. It is great especially if you are considering the other attractions like the Sampan/Boat Ride, F&B at The Shoppes and retail experience with discounts too.
Thank you for the wonderful experience and memories MBS! See you soon :)",Date of stay:
Fun Staycation,"Staycation was memorable. We got a Premier room on the 37th floor, with a bathtub and a city view.

Pros:
- Great views from room, and a good size too.
- Excellent and warm service by all, from concierge to housekeeping. A shoutout to the pool staff who were friendly and helped make each swim enjoyable, no matter what time of day.
- Bathtub in room, and some complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the minibar.
- Infinity pool was wonderful. We were there three times, at sunrise, evening and late evening. Loved the jacuzzi too. Good that only hotel guests can use this as it cuts down on numbers in the pool. Also, you can book a daily timeslot, which is great.
- Easy access to Gardens By The Bay, and MRT at doorstep (we did not use this)
- Access to food options within the building, or just over at the Gardens. But not all the food was that great.

Cons: .
- Room was dated, with mold in the bathroom. They are renovating rooms in Tower 2 currently.
- Housekeeping can be improved. Dust in bathroom ceiling and room carpets.
- Shower area does not drain fully, and you need to use the feet to push the water towards the rain area. Otherwise, could become slippery and cause guest to slip.
- Funky smell in lift lobby area, so much so that they had to run an ozone machine for a couple of days.
- Wait for lifts from room floors can take a while especially around meal times when diners head to the restaurants at the rooftop.

Tip: If you drive, you can park at the Shoppes area, but only for one exit. We parked there for three days, and paid $8.80 at the end of the stay after getting a parking chit from the concierge desk. If you prefer valet parking, it costs @$12 per 24 hour block, but you can have multiple entries and exits.",Date of stay:
spacious room and splendid views 😍,"we’ve got the king deluxe room with a gardens by the bay view.The view was spectacular and couldn’t imagine a better 360 view of gardens by the way.As an expat living in Singapore this was a splendid view and amazing view too.

A+++ on service,"2nd time staying here (last time being 5+ years ago) and still amazing even during a pandemic.

- Check-in process is cleverly covid-safe designed to stagger people so no crowding in the lobby. You book a time slot and can track when it's your turn to approach a counter online.

- Sky Infinity Pool access is no longer unlimited time, COVID era unfortunately however it is super safe with guests needing to book a time slot in advance. each time slot session ends they clean the area for the next lot of guests. Capped guest limit is a blessing in disguise, so much easier to take photos and have a swim now!

- Super attentive service by all staff we encountered or walked past in the hallways. Also came to us with a cake as it was our anniversary. Wow factor

Note that there is currently construction work in the middle tower from what I could see so some unlucky guests might hear noise but we were in tower 1 (L26) so did not hear any construction.

Nice stay at Marina Bay Sands,"It is my 2nd visit to MBS hotel.

The environment seemed relaxed at lobby ,as well as lift area where there were no Social Distancing Ambassadors ( I nicknamed them Red Guards) manning entrance of the lifts of Tower 1,2 and 3.

I am totally impressed by the hotel efficiency, really world class!

I booked a room in Dec 2021, for Feb 2022 stay, I also order afternoon tea set in Dec 2021.

few hours before I go to hotel, I received SMS telling me to arrive at hotel in specific time and tower .

I went to the hotel lobby at about 1.50pm.

Stand for a while and wait for my Queue Number to be called.

Check in was effortless and receptionist told me that my afternoon tea set will be delivered to my room in 20 minutes or so.

(thats efficient )

25 minutes later, afternoon tea set arrived  and it was 2 tier -sandwiches and sweet savouries .

I brewed coffee from Coffee machine.

There, I was having meal and coffee in room, overlooking the nice view of harbour, and the sea..

I know why this hotel is hot favourite during National Day because military aircrafts fly pass the bay area which hotel is located.

Then rest in bed till 4.45pm.. Getting ready for swimming pool at 5.20pm, after contacting Room service for evening turndown and collection of food tray from my room.

I went to Level 57, and it was 5.10 pm.

Thus, I went to area where I admired the view of sea and cold breeze.

After that I went to check in at swimming pool area, I walked along the path where  I pick the place near towel collection area, and placed my towel, clothes and went to swim. (quite comfortable, no crowded ,Thus, I swim to the side where I can see the buildings ( I recognised some of them ) and sea.

Then swim to and fro  few  times, then do underwater exercise.

Then rest at chair, looking around.. There are staffs in white uniform , red , and blue uniform.

White uniform staffs in charge of towels - providing guests towel, and rescue guest if he has issues. (white uniform with red cross)

Red uniform - Social Distancing Ambassadors.

Blue uniform - bar staffs serving cocktails and drinks, bar foods.

Time almost up. I went back to room and bathe and head to MBS mall to do window shopping, and observe the food court , restaurants- full of activites.

Then went back to hotel , heading to Origin + Bloom cafe intending to order bread, hot chocolate, and fruits.

Unfortunately, food and drink items not available, and thus I take fruits and went back to hotel room ,and eat fruits , watch my favourite local drama on TV

Then surf net on my laptop till it was time to sleep

I look at sea at night... it was beautiful sight..

Morning, woke up.

and book a gym slot at Level 55, Tower 2. 

Reply come almost immediate

I then took lift down to level 1 lobby and then cross over to Tower 2 and then took lift to Level 55.

I was impressed by the classy gym area.

Social distancing are strictly observed and there are partion in between at gym machines.

I began work out at cardio area for 20 mins, before moving to another gym machines.

Time almost up, at 8 am.

Take note when book a gym. You cannot book slot in advance unlike swimming pool.

When you send SMS to Gym, you are given slot to go to gym in 15 minutes time immediately..

I went down to level 1 and then cross over to Tower 3 ,and took lift up.

Reaching my room, I took wallet and MBS membership card to go to Raspura Masters for breakfast where I had dim sum , kopi and fruit platter for less than $20.

To Hotel Management: take note : there are a lot of scams involving Marina Bay Sands- membership scam, casino scam..

There are also room scam and Club 55 voucher scam.

Room scam- there is a lot of ads on MBS room - deluxe room advertise at cheaper price , less than $300 per night.. 

There are club room and grand club room scam where agents will deal with MBS staff to allocate booking of rooms for extra fees.

Club 55 voucher - agents will give you voucher where you get free breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails if you pay such agents $80.

In reality, Hotel is under intensive renovation at some areas where club rooms / grand room clubs are located. Thus all club room and grand club rooms are closed. and there are no such things as Club 55 vouchers. (hotel manager told me this few months ago when I made enquiry.)

Will come and stay in hotel again when free.",Date of stay:

Best hotel service I have ever had,"Checked in here mid February and very much enjoyed the hotel. First the check in process was quick and professional. I even got a complimentary upgrade by signing up as a rewards member which was a nice surprise. The room was extremely clean and contained complimentary drinks and snacks in the mini bar and fridge which gets stocked daily.

The staff here were phenomenal! From housekeeping staff to lifeguards at the pool I was greeted at every entrance, making conversation and genuinely happy to see me. The staff member Ryan (pool lifeguard) did a fantastic effort in making sure my experience at the pool was the best it could be. He offered me a towel as a headrest, took a few photos of me and made sure i my experience at the pool was constantly met. He and other staff members made my experience at MBS that much better.

The highlight of the stay here was the infinity pool, you do need to book, however it means that the pool area is really quiet to the point where I have the entire pool to myself at particular moments of the day.

Overall, this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. Customer service was phenomenal, overall service was great and had an amazing experience that I will never forget. Thank you MBS.",Date of stay:
Awesome Stay-cation,"It was an awesome experience to stay at this hotel. We were greeted by Joanne from Premium Services upon our arrival and was very informative and very helpful with our needs during our stay. From pool to dining reservations, she handled it like a pro!
We stayed at Orchid Suite City View and we were amazed by the view and the space of the room. We have an unobstructed view of the city skyline.
We also had a great time at Club 55 from afternoon tea to Evening Drinks until next day’s breakfast!
It was a very memorable stay and thank you for the staff who made this stay awesome.
Special mention to Miss Joanne Gonzaga of Premium Services, and Miss Vella and Miss Kate from Club 55 for taking care of us all throughout our stay! You guys did a great job!",Date of stay:
An (Almost) Great MBS Experience,"Due to the pandemic and the fluid nature of border restrictions, we opted to spend our anniversary this year in Singapore again.

We opted for 3 separate staycations and, in order to compare the hotels we’ve chosen, the duration for each of our staycations was the same duration and over the same days of different weeks.

Marina Bay Sands was our second staycation.

We had stayed once before but that memory was become fuzzy. All I could remember was that the restroom was huge.

Actually we didn’t plan to stay at the MBS. However, due to the availability of a promotion, we decided to have our second staycation there – and boy were we glad we did.

We always opt for rooms with club benefits. However, during the period of our staycation, all the rooms with club access were under renovation and only suites were available. I decided against going for a suite since we would probably just stay on bed the whole time and would not be able to justify the hefty costs for the extra space in the suite.

Hence, it was with trepidation that we booked for our stay from December 14 to 16 2021.

My wife was so apprehensive about the prospect of a staycation without club benefits that she wanted to cancel it.

Pros:
1. MBS makes full use of technology. Prior to our check-in, we received a link to select our preferred check-in time. This totally removed the need to speak with the front desk at the start of our staycation. We also got to book our slots for the use of the infinity pools and other hotel facilities.

2. The hotel is really serious about its safe management measures. This is the ONLY hotel that checks in every guest who uses the lifts to the room and checks out every guest who exits the lifts. There is no way extra ‘guests’ can make their way into the guest rooms.

3. The air-con in the room works fantastically well. The room was chilled to the level of our liking!

4. Although we stayed in an ordinary room, the mini bar was replenished daily and it was free!
What a treat!

5. I have always thought that having a TV in the room was a silly idea. However, MBS managed to change that opinion of mine because its smart TV was easy to connect to my phone and we could watch Netflix on TV.
I have stayed in hotels that have smart TVs that are impossible to connect. Staying at the MBS was like staying at home – only better.

6. My initial thought that the check-in process was one that was going to spoil my staycation due to the sheer number of people at the lobby. However my personal experience was a super pleasant one. I was ushered into a room with a seat and was attended to by a very thorough and professional Ms Adilah. Ms Adilah did not ask questions as a filler or just to make small talk. She asked questions so that she could provide solutions. For example, she asked if I have booked for my pool sessions. When I told her I could not get a timing for the first day, she took the trouble to secure a slot after making a few checks.
To me, the checking in process sets the tone for my stay.
Thank you, Ms Adilah!

7. There are a lot to do at the Marina Shoppes. Because my membership was upgraded to the next tier, it made shopping and dinning at the restaurants linked via the escalators an even better experience.

8. Checking out was equally efficient. No forms. No queues. Just drop your room card and its done.

Cons:

Normally I would have a long list of cons. For MBS, the ONLY negative point I would give was for our unfortunate dinner experience at the Rise Restaurant located in the lobby.
Not only was the waiting time for our food unduly long, the taste way of the fried rice and satay were below mediocre.
I really don’t think the restaurant can justify the 40-minute waiting time for a plate of fried rice and a few sticks of satay.

Moreover, our order of satay came undercooked!

The mutton was impossible to chew and the meat was red and bloody. I had to spit it out.

When I informed the wait staff, the remaining 2 sticks of satay were sent back to the kitchen and returned - charred and inedible.

On hindsight, I thought even a regular restaurant would have prepared another 2-3 sticks of satay and served them to us instead of taking the undercooked ones back into the kitchen to char them.

Given the current pandemic situation, I thought the restaurant should have known better.

Moreover, I would say that the satay served at Rise was of the worst I’ve tasted offered by any restaurants in any hotel.

This is definitely does not live up to an MBS standard and reputation.

The dinner at Rise was the only bad experience we had during our short staycation. It kinds of spoilt our dinner on the second night of our stay.

Would we stay again? We would love to experience the club lounge at the Marina Bay Sands Singapore. I want to believe it is going to be of a standard above the rest. But we’ll probably never going to step into Rise again.",Date of stay:
Fantastic stay and Superb Service,"My husband and I checked in last weekend and we really had a great stay with this hotel. We booked a club room with club access. Our room is really big, clean and nice. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Vincent and Aries for taking care of us while we were having afternoon tea and cocktails. We really appreciate their efforts in making sure we were okey while we were at Club55. Sometimes the service is reason why the guest comes back and I can say that those people convinced us to come back through the BEST service that they provided to us. Kudos to MBS and all the staff. We will definitely come back.",Date of stay:

Horrible hospitality and customer service,"I tried to book a hotel reservation with the company and they refuse to send me a confirmation. I need this reservation for my travel visa to Singapore with friends and family, but I've been waiting DAYS for their confirmation and because of it, missed my chance to apply for VISA.

For the families that did go, they canceled their booking with marina Bay sands after their horrendous customer service. The front desk was incredibly rude when we needed help with check in.

Priort to arrival, when we asked for a manager, he promptly ignored our inquiries about whether or not we need to:
1. quarantine in the hotel until a negative test
2. would send us a confirmation email for room reservation

When my family went to the actual hotel to speak to a supervisor about this, they said it was out of their hands that they can't control their managers response times. What?

What kind of customer service is this? Additionally, it took a long time for them to check us in. The situation was so horrible and I heavily don't recommend this place for future travellers.

We promptly cancelled our reservation, without caring for a refund, and departed to another hotel that appreciated our service. Super disappointed and will be warning all of my peers from this place.",Date of stay:
Great Views and Great Staff,"Booked 2 rooms due to large family and Stayed over the New Year break. Fantastic views from the room. The staff were excellent all the way down to housekeeping. Special call out to my attendant who topped up kids drinks in our mini bar when he saw our horde of munchkins.

View from Pool was incredible as was all the food there in general. I would point out to any one trying to stay there over peak periods to book early. This includes dining reservations. Up to a week prior to my stay, all restaurants were already booked out - totally my own fault for not thinking further ahead. On the upside, the room service is incredible and serves pretty much 24 hrs.

Would come back for sure.",Date of stay:

Excellent 3 days 2 nights staycation. We were lucky to have a room on the high floors and view was amazing. Check-in and out we're a breeze. Service staff from the front desk, housekeeping and general staff were friendly and polite.
Wifi was free and worked well.

They have fabulous food from Club55, Spago, Rise, Renku and in-room dining.

Every detail is just so well thought of, staff are customer oriented. I am very impressed and will definitely return to stay if I’m back in Singapore. Even the lifeguard Ryan was so proactive to help us take family photos.

If there is a slight improvement needed, it would be Stella from the infinity pool service team, she could have been more polite to ask and check with her other colleagues instead of brushing us aside when we said we did not receive the QR code for the swimming pool booking.

Overall, it is still a 5 star rating.",Date of stay:
An iconic building with the best views in Singapore,"Marina Bay Sands is an iconic building with the best views in Singapore, overlooking the skyline and Gardens by the Bay.

The hotel is well know for the more than spectacular ininity pool on the 57th floor with super views of Singapore.

In this hotel you find everything you need, many great options for dining and drinking. My favorite is the Sunday brunch at Lavo. Wow it is good!

The staff is talanted and very well trained. The quality of service was excellent. Special thanks to Mustika in the reception lounge who made my stay more than wonderful!

Fantastic!,"My friend and I had booked a stay at MBS during November (Covid SSM still in place). Shirley checked us in on the desk and organised a special room for us. We were taken to our room - the veiw across the city was brilliant. The room was tidy and clean. The bathroom and bath tub were excellent. We booked a pool slot for the day time and lifeguard Moe was very friendly and helpful. We were able to book an evening slot for the pool too (really recommend doing this if you can) and Leo was the pool attendant at night. Again very helpful and friendly. Other mentions for excellent staff: Kate and Camille and Zack. Overall, a brilliant stay with excellent staff. Thank you!",Date of stay:

As usual with Singapore there were stringent covid rules.",Date of stay:
Service over & above the rest!,"I am writing this mail to compliment the amazing set of crew at the infinity pool. The service rendered to me was out of this world.

I would like to particularly compliment LIFEGUARD KELVIN for providing service over and above the rest. He was extremely helpful and had a lot of initiative. He continuously kept checking on all of the hotel guests’ safety & comfort. Staff like him should be recognized rendering such top quality service from his heart. He took pride in his work. He is definitely an asset to the company.

Thanks to this wonderful set of crew, I truly enjoyed my experience with your hotel and am definitely coming back and sharing my experience on all social media platforms.

Once again, thank you Marina Bay Sands (Infinity pool team) for the memorable experience.

Yours truly,

Overpriced View,"I am basing my review on equivalent hotels worldwide at the price of over $600 a night which what I paid per night. Firstly I booked a City View and the room has an incredible view, we slept with the blinds open as it was so amazing. We were on level 35. The room is good, but not amazing for this price. The room we had at the Hyatt was double the size for less money and the service was equally as good.

You could only book the famous infinity pool for 1 hour a day that is it and the spaces are limited, so you may end up like many people with a timeslot that is not great. The gym was the same, you have to book which was relatively simple, but we arrived after the Singapore NY festivities, so it was alot quieter. For this price, I would expect a little more customer service like using the pool and gym a little more than once a day. I couldn't even get a drink or a coffee at the pool and the pool water was freezing. Even the staff agreed that the water is freezing.

The check in process was long. There were no queues, but it feels like they are doing background checks etc as it takes a long time to get a room key. For example to get in and out of room at the elevator lobby, there is a guard that records your room number. I even received a call while at dinner from the hotel asking me to approve another credit card deposit as they only took out $400 when I checked in. I wasn't really sure why the man was calling me and interrupting my dinner when they had my credit card and I was going to pay. So we checked into Tower 3, but when we were waiting in Tower 1 to go to dinner, there are these people dressed in red tops. They are the hotel police that literally are looking for any excuse to call you out for sitting in the wrong place. My mask slipped to the tip of my nose, not below my nose and I was told off. Again for this price, I wouldn't stay here again as I had way better experiences at the other hotels that treat you like a VIP guest.

We ended up going back to Orchard everyday anyway as it so much better than Marina Bay. This is my second stay. now I have experienced both sides of the hotel, I definitely won't stay again at these prices. I only booked it to impress my girlfriend.",Date of stay:
Very Pathetic Customer Service,"I booked two rooms for 2 days for my family of 6 under the Sandsational Staycation package over the Christmas holidays. On the MBS website, it says that complimentary breakfast would be provided if you sign up as a Sands Reward Member. What I experienced was having to jump through multiple hoops and walking back and forth between Tower 1 and Tower 3 on multiple occasions to get the breakfast voucher.
To the hotel's credit and our pleasant surprise, they allowed us to check in early at 9 a.m. and the process at Tower 3 reception was smooth. However, we were told to go to Tower 1 Sands Rewards counter to get our physical membership card. When I went there in the afternoon, there was a long queue at the counter. I was told that after getting the card, I needed to go to the machine to collect our breakfast vouchers. There was another queue for the single machine, but Mr Zack Chang told me I could go to the other machine at Tower 1. So I walked back but found the queue no better. I then returned to Tower 3 and queued again. However, after going through all the options in the machine, I could not see any vouchers. I then asked Mr Chang for help. He said it was not yet in the system and asked me to come back half an hour later. Long walk back to my room in Tower 3 and back to Tower 1 half an hour later. Still nothing in the machine. Mr Chang then offered to write out the vouchers for me manually, but only for 4 persons. I told him that we had an email from MBS that confirmed breakfast for 6. He said the rewards system is separate from the hotel system, so I would have to check with the restaurant. After some argument with him, he finally agreed to issue vouchers for 6.
I also asked about breakfast for the following day and he said it would be in the machine by the next day. Guess what? The next day, the machine only had breakfast vouchers for 3 persons! Long walk again to Tower 1, queue again and this time it was Mr Wong Wei Siang. It was like a re-enactment of the movie Edge of Tomorrow starring Tom Cruise. He had no idea what happened the day before. I had to explain the whole story again. He scrolled through his computer for 20 minutes and still could not understand the problem. I then request that he wrote out the vouchers for me manually. By now, I was not surprised when he said the same thing: We were entitled to only 4 vouchers; the remaining 2 had to pay! If I had a problem I needed to take this up with the hotel and restaurant separately!
I explained that 6 of us had eaten breakfast that morning and he could verify with the RISE restaurant After a heated discussion, he finally agreed to issue vouchers for 6. I had to go off by then for another event. So long walk back to Tower 3 and later in the day return to Tower 1 again to collect the vouchers. If the hotel had any sense of service, they would have offered to leave them in our room after putting us through all that hassle.
It's obvious that there is little coordination between the Sands Reward team and the hotel side. The Reward team is there basically to support the casino and clearly sees serving the hotel customers as a burdensome chore, unless they are high-rollers. Even though we don't gamble, we had paid over $800 per room per night, and the level of service was truly appalling.
I ran into another problem when I was checking out. I asked for two separate bills for the two rooms. I was told by the lady at the counter that it could not be done. Why not? The incredible answer was that at check-in they had taken one single deposit for both rooms using the one credit card! I patiently pointed out that I had intentionally made two separate bookings, because I wanted two bills. After I insisted, the lady made some phone calls, and then tried to dissuade me again. I stood my ground, and she finally cancelled the deposit and billed me separately for the two rooms. The good thing was I got lots of exercise from staying there but I doubt I will come back.",Date of stay:
First and last time here,"So much for safe distancing when there is no proper waiting area and massive crowd waiting to checkin. Everyone just standing in crowds outside the shops. Massive waiting times to check in. We understand COVID-19 is leading to more checks and measures but to wait 1-2 hours for checkin is really unacceptable.
Service level below average for the supposed top tier hotel. And more long queues for breakfast at the hotel. Management needs to look at themselves as to why there are long queues everywhere. Poor staffing planning. The poor staff are overworked and overwhelmed due to shortage of staff. Looks like the existing staff need to cover 3 persons work at the expense of 1.
Social distancing measures are a joke. Having stayed at other hotels the intrusion of privacy and constant surveillance every time you go in and out of the room is ridiculous. Take a long hard look at yourself sands management cos no other hotels are doing what you’re doing and how disorganised everything is.
Safe ambassadors are a joke and on a power trip with lack of basic courtesy",Date of stay:
"Not first time MBS hotel staycation but probably my last, at least for awhile.","I remembered the first time I stayed at MBS hotel. It was my birthday and my husband(then bf) arranged a surprise staycation for me at MBS. Everything was perfect. Then we have this thought to have staycation at MBS for at least once a year. Last year, we have our ROM and Honeymoon staycation at MBS in Aug 2020 and Oct 2020. I can say that was the most memorable stay at MBS. The staff that attended to us auto-upgraded our room to club room for FOC and give us a late check-out. All the staff we met was friendly greeting us(except for the staff at club 55 that served those guest that booked the club room as we are not aware only those guest that ""booked"" the club room is allow to enter the facility and we are given ""FOC"" for the club room so we are not allow to enter, the staff explain that to us with a ""look down on people"" face and tone). But we still enjoyed the staycation as we met many more other friendly staff. In Dec 2020, I arranged a staycation at MBS again to celebrate my husband birthday. During then, the staff attended to us was ok too and try to fulfil on our request. Though we met some unhappiness back then, but the staff tried to rectify the issue quickly for us. But this year, Dec 2021, when I arranged staycation at MBS for my husband birthday, I was very very surprise with all the ""new"" stuff that I am not aware of during my past stay in MBS.

Firstly, the check-out time is 11am(which I am really surprised, as during my past stay, the earliest checkout was 12PM, latest was 1PM).
Secondly, the parking is not FOC for guest. For this I swear I really had no idea during my past stay. If not my husband want to confirm and asked me to check with the staff, we could have pay for the parking for this staycation and I am sure the amount is not a small sum. But for this, at least the staff attended to us say she will give us a complimentary parking at last.
Thirdly, I indicated that it is a birthday surprise for my husband. I am glad the staff wished my husband ""Happy birthday"" during check-in. But she actually told my husband that they will send a cake to us from 3pm. Which it become not a surprise. Other 4 or 5 stars hotel I stayed before will make this arrangement as a ""surprise"" without informing you in advance. That is the reason why we put it as ""special request"" isn't it?
Fourth, the room that was upgraded for us is nothing compared to the one we stayed during our ROM and Honeymoon staycation. But for this, probably we are putting too high expectation from MBS based on our past experienced, hence, was rather disappointed.
Fifth, the Covid-19 virus still exist, during last year stay there is plastic vacuum for the cup, towel, amenity to assure the guest for the cleanliness. But I am not sure why this time round there is no such ""safety"" effort.
Sixth, the cake that was told will be send to our room was late. I even called the service to check and then they managed to deliver it to us at last close to 10pm. I was really worry it might past my husband birthday by the time they send the cake to our room.

I would say the whole experience for the staycation this time make me and my husband felt that what we paid is not worth what we received. There is really nothing special about MBS if I were to compare it with other 5 stars hotel. With this price, probably I can receive a better treatment from other hotel. My husband is even the member of MBS but I would say there is nothing you can expect from MBS even if you are the member of MBS.",Date of stay:
"Comfortable, Decadent couple stay during Covid","We had a complimentary upgrade and my request for a quiet room was met as it was away from the elevator. The wait till check in was heavily regulated due to Covid but the service was fantastic. I signed up for an MBS membership that same day too. The room was very classy, clean and had a great view of the Gardens by the bay. We booked our pool slot in advance and loved the view from the top too. Despite the ever-changing measures for Covid (we could not dine in at that time), I had to order food as takeaway from restaurants. The food was packed well and I made sure to order it before the dinner crowd arrived. Some of the entrances and exits were a bit confusing though. Having the MBS membership is a plus because it applies to all shops and restaurants in the shoppes and hotel. Would definitely stay again for the air-conditioned atmosphere (everything is interconnected apart from the gardens) and privacy.",Date of stay:
Staycation - 2 nights with breakfast and $100 dining credits,"I stayed at marina bay sands for 2 nights. This is a large hotel and there are things to take note of.

1. Booking or pool
You can book for a slot at the infinity pool 1 day prior to check in. For our stay. We have 3 slots. 1 slot per day. Each 1 hour 15 mins.
You can book all slots at the same time.
I would advise you to book earlier as many slots are not available when I tried to book.

2. Check in
The check in time is at 3pm. I reached the hotel at 2:45 and have a hard time self parking. In the end I valet park instead. The hotel car parking is surprisingly full with many cars waiting for an empty lot.

In the end I was at the check in counter at 3:10. I have to wait for about 15 mins before I check in. A bit of waiting.

3. Room

The room is decent. The tv is large but the movie Channels is very poor. Most movies are very old.

I have a room on 36th floor at the Tower 3. The view from the room marvelous.

4. Pool
Make sure you have slots in the day time and night time. The night view from the pool is very beautiful.
with capacity limit the pool is not crowded at all. The entry of the slots is enforced very strictly.

5. Breakfast
I have a choice of breakfast in the room, at spago on the 57th floor or ar Rise on the ground floor.

I tried spago first. The food is ok and not as good as what they served in Rise. Also the morning sun is very glaring and the table is very low. Not a relaxing breakfast experience. I went very early and do not have to wait to eat or be served.

The second breakfast at rise is nicer. But I was there later and have to wait. They are very short staffed and the wait is very very long. Something to bear in mind if you have plans in the mornings after breakfast.",Date of stay:

Staycation @ MBS (11-13 Dec 2021)-Compliments for Mr Moe (Lifeguard).,"We have met Mr. Moe (Infinity Pool Lifeguard) whom I would say is someone who is full of passion towards his job as he have always been in hospitality industry previous and interacting with international visitors.

He’s one of the more friendly, outspoken, helpful and will introduce about the awesomeness about MBS.

He helped visitors to take beautiful photos for them to keep as memories, inform you when will be the best time to take photos at the Skypark etc…

Despite we have met him only for once, we find him a person who is so passionate about his work, he’s more of a tour guide Cum lifeguard, not many are like him.

Almost 5 star,"All these are good.
Transportation, location, ease of check-in, checkout, concierge, staff politeness, cleanliness, minibar items, distance to shopping mall/casino/restaurants, views from infinity pool and observation deck.

These can be improved
-I was not allowed to drink 'outside' drink at the infinity pool resting chair, but I brought that 'outside' drink from hotel's very own minibar in the room🤣🤣😂

-Rise quality of breakfast can be further improved. The bacon in Western set was too hard. So as the youtiao in Chinese set. The congee, century egg, and soup based wonton Mee is bland. Finally the curry puff in malay set has too much curry powder taste.",Date of stay:
"One place, two types of staff","The parking situation at MBS was very crowded and I missed my check in time by 15mins. I approached a service staff at the reception area and she mentioned that I will have to come back again in 2 hours to check in, advised me to put my luggage at the holding area and ""have some coffee"" for 2 hours. This is a disappointing way of handling a customer request. We were late due to the horrendous parking situation and now further punished by having to wait for 2 hours for a room that is already ready? She did not bother to make any effort to give us a good holiday experience. Undeterred and simmering in anger for 5 mins, I asked another service staff for help and this tall bald indian guy made a different. I explained the situation, he directed us to an existing physical queue and I checked in successful in 5 mins, no 2 hours wait. I have 20 years of customer service experience and I always try my best to empathize with the customer and give them the best experience, not just simply repeating rules and regulation.

For the Infinity pool booking system, it is an unfair system with no penalty for no show. I wasnt able to book a slot at night and went up for a ""walk in"" but was told I cant. Its saddening that my MBS experience is not complete with a night view of the city line from the infinity pool. It was so close, the pool was quite empty! But the slots were taken up by no shows!",Date of stay:
Great room with great view,"We got a room with a garden view on the 25th floor, Both the night view and day view are amazing. The room amenities and infinity pool are great too. We are just disappointed that they longer serve a la carte buffet breakfast. MBS has a lot of activities for toddlers and children. It's a great place for a family staycation.",Date of stay:
Luxury stay redefined by MBS' total service concept,"Military precision operation with hearts and soul - something other city hotels can learn from.

Making up for the lack of historical legacy and geographical location, MBS boasts of grandiose in its unique architectural style and all-hands-on-deck service that is uniquely Singapore.

Few hotels in the can match the breathtaking panorama from the 2000+ guest rooms. My advice is to opt for one with a city view.

Rooms are impeccably appointed and cleaned. Mine ($500 per night) is humongous with two very huge independently controlled LCD TV.

Techies will like that the hotel system is linked to restaurants and brand-name shops across the MBS campus.

Foodies will appreciate the gastronomic experience of savoring the best of the best cuisines from traditional to fusion.

Families will love the diverse range of activities and options for everyone.

Last but not least, the tycoons will know that they will be accorded the VVVIP treatment even before they set foot here.",Date of stay:
Awesome service!,"Travelling with 2 young children and we overlook to book the check-in. A tall Indian guy (didn't catch his name) in suit was kind to offer us assistance while we were waiting for our turn. So appreciative of the gesture as our one year old is getting cranky.

After check in we called to request for amenities and upon knowing that we are celebrating my sister birthday the operator (Wesley?) actually sang a happy birthday song for my sis over the phone. It's quite an experience haha.

Also, kudos to the housekeeper of #2767 (didn't manage to catch the name either). On the 2nd day when we left the room and saw him cleaning the other room, we requested for additional shower gel. Was afraid he won't remember but he did!

The attention to details and the service has been exemplary! Thank you for such a nice stay will definitely return again!

The team has been very nice to us and the kids. It's my little niece favourite hotel!",Date of stay:
Destination luxury resort,"We stayed here on our last day in Singapore, primarily for the use of their infinity pool. Staff is superb, breakfast buffet is awesome and great for the value. Garden by the bay is just next door so super convenient. The food court is great if you need a break from the fancy restaurants.",Date of stay:
Great Experience,"First, I would like to commend on our bulter, Brady and Amirah. They were very friendly, and professional. They were always around, greeting us in the lobby, leading us to our room for check-in, doing the turn down daily and delivering afternoon snacks. They also suggested that book Club 55 BF on a daily basis, recommending that we try the afternoon tea and evening Cannapés. I made 2 last-minute pool requests and manage to secure the slot with the help of the butler services. Before our butlers went for their off-days, they made sure to arrange our transfer from the hotel to our home. Also, the staff from Club55 were very pleasant and professional. The Afternoon Tea, Cannapés, and Breakfast Buffet were good.

This is my second stay with MBS in 2021. We were here in Sept for my son's birthday and this time is for my Birthday. Both experiences were great, with unexpected but welcome surprises. We were initially disappointed when we could not secure the suite with the pool table. In the lift on the way to our room, Butler Brady assured us that they had prepared a surprise for us. On entering the room, we found the room festooned with balloons and decorations, and even received a birthday cake at night. We are very thankful for the effort put into making my birthday at MBS an enjoyable and memorable experience.

Great stay, hope to be back soon",Date of stay:
Wonderful stay at MBS,"Would like to give a thumbs up to the services provided at MBS. Got an upgrade to Orchid suite for staying over during our wedding weekend. A super pleasant surprise. Check in was done at Sands Lounge- Renee who was serving us at the lounge was super patient and friendly explaining to us the perks.

Then when we went up to the room, we were so impressed by the view we had! We could see the gardens and the harbour directly below us. The room had a small balcony that is sufficient for us to stand and chill with the breeze. The bathroom came with a super spacious vanity room with a bath tub too! Special thanks for Sean Liaw for all this arrangement, including a bottle of champagne and some mini chocolates... again small touch that goes a long way....

Breakfast was delicious at RISE, which we didn’t have to wait too long as were down at around 830am. Subsequently after 9 am there was a long queue forming up already. The pool - just one tip- please book once you are given the link if not you will not stand a chance to do so.

Do not pick 6am or any night slots if you are someone who hates cold water and chill wind.

Will spend the remaining of the day chilling with a book in the room to enjoy our day! Thank you for MBS for giving us such a memorable honeymoon stay! Will come
back again!",Date of stay:
Room with Greenery View,"Staycaytion happened in November 2020. We booked a room for 3pax with an add-on of an additional bed at $600+ for 1 night which was a little on the pricier end as it was a room only booking with no breakfast. However, guests do enjoy discounts at certain food outlets in the mall (we purchased takeaway from TAP).

Room and bathroom was capacious as there was still space for a small dining area even with the additional bed (which was set next to the balcony). Even though we stayed on a lower floor, we were blessed with a good view of Gardens by the Bay. Room came with Roberto Cavalli toiletries and towels.

Check-in took some time but from the queue, we can definitely see the team trying their best to check-in as promptly as they can. A small amenities bag with masks and sanitizers were given upon check-in too. Downside to this stay was that screen casting was unavailable with the in-room TV and it was raining with lightning in vicinity during the pool slot we booked hence, we were unable to enjoy a dip in the infinity pool. Nevertheless, it was a comfortable stay :)",Date of stay:
Review of recent stay at Marina Bay Sands,"I had a great stay, with my family for a anniversary stay. All the hotel staff that attended to us are friendly and fantastic.
